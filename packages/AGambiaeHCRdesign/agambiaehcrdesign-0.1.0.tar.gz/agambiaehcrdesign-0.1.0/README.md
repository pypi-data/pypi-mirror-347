Welcome!

This is a python repository to generate HCR v3.0 probes for in situ hybridization visualization of mRNA in Anopheles Gambiae.
The module allows for quick and easy design of probe pairs for the Hybridization Chain Reaction approach (Choi et al. Development 2018.)

Dependencies: 
BLAST+
Install BLAST+ by downloading executable from https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/

The A. Gambiae PEST genome data is available to download at https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/downloads/Current_Release/AgambiaePEST/fasta/data
This dataset should be formatted into a BLAST database.

To build a BLAST database, use the BLAST+ 'makeblastdb' command.
