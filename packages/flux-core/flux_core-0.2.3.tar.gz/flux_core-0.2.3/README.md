# Flux

Flux is a distributed workflow orchestration engine written in Python that enables building stateful and fault-tolerant workflows. It provides an intuitive programming model for creating complex, reliable distributed applications with built-in support for state management, error handling, and execution control.

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Stateful Execution**: Full persistence of workflow state and execution history
- **Distributed Architecture**: Support for both local and distributed execution modes
- **High Performance**: Efficient parallel task execution and workflow processing
- **Type Safety**: Leverages Python type hints for safer workflow development
- **API Integration**: Built-in FastAPI server for HTTP-based workflow execution

### Task Management
- **Flexible Task Configuration**:
  ```python
  @task.with_options(
      retry_max_attempts=3,        # Auto-retry failed tasks
      retry_delay=1,              # Initial delay between retries
      retry_backoff=2,            # Exponential backoff for retries
      timeout=30,                 # Task execution timeout
      fallback=fallback_func,     # Fallback handler for failures
      rollback=rollback_func,     # Rollback handler for cleanup
      secret_requests=['API_KEY'] # Secure secrets management
  )
  ```

### Workflow Patterns
- **Task Parallelization**: Execute multiple tasks concurrently
- **Pipeline Processing**: Chain tasks in sequential processing pipelines
- **Subworkflows**: Compose complex workflows from simpler ones
- **Task Mapping**: Apply tasks across collections of inputs
- **Graph-based Workflows**: Define workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Modify workflow behavior based on runtime conditions

### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Automatic Retries**: Configurable retry policies with backoff
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Define alternative execution paths
- **Rollback Support**: Clean up after failures
- **Exception Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Timeout Management**: Prevent hung tasks and workflows

### State Management
- **Execution Persistence**: Durable storage of workflow state
- **Pause & Resume**: Control workflow execution flow
- **Deterministic Replay**: Automatic replay of workflow events to maintain consistency
- **State Inspection**: Monitor workflow progress and state

## Installation

```bash
pip install flux-core
```

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.12 or later
- Dependencies are managed through Poetry

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Workflow

Create a simple workflow that processes input:

```python
from flux import task, workflow, WorkflowExecutionContext

@task
def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}"

@workflow
def hello_world(ctx: WorkflowExecutionContext[str]):
    return (yield say_hello(ctx.input))

# Execute locally
result = hello_world.run("World")
print(result.output)  # "Hello, World"
```

### 2. Parallel Task Execution

Execute multiple tasks concurrently:

```python
from flux import task, workflow
from flux.tasks import parallel

@workflow
def parallel_workflow(ctx: WorkflowExecutionContext[str]):
    results = yield parallel(
        task1(ctx.input),
        task2(ctx.input),
        task3(ctx.input)
    )
    return results
```

### 3. Pipeline Processing

Chain tasks in a processing pipeline:

```python
from flux.tasks import pipeline

@workflow
def pipeline_workflow(ctx: WorkflowExecutionContext[int]):
    result = yield pipeline(
        multiply_by_two,
        add_three,
        square,
        input=ctx.input
    )
    return result
```

### 4. Task Mapping

Apply a task across multiple inputs:

```python
@workflow
def map_workflow(ctx: WorkflowExecutionContext[list[str]]):
    results = yield process_item.map(ctx.input)
    return results
```

## Advanced Usage

### Workflow Control
#### State Management
```python
# Resume existing workflow execution
ctx = workflow.run(execution_id="previous_execution_id")

# Check workflow state
print(f"Finished: {ctx.finished}")
print(f"Succeeded: {ctx.succeeded}")
print(f"Failed: {ctx.failed}")

# Inspect workflow events
for event in ctx.events:
    print(f"{event.type}: {event.value}")
```

### Error Handling

```python
@task.with_options(
    retry_max_attempts=3,
    retry_delay=1,
    retry_backoff=2,
    fallback=lambda: "fallback result",
    rollback=cleanup_function
)
def risky_task():
    # Task implementation with comprehensive error handling
    pass
```

### Secret Management

```python
@task.with_options(secret_requests=["API_KEY"])
def secure_task(secrets: dict[str, Any] = {}):
    api_key = secrets["API_KEY"]
    # Use API key securely
```

## API Server

Start the API server for HTTP-based workflow execution:

```bash
flux start myworkflows
```

Execute workflows via HTTP:
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/workflow_name' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '"input_data"'
```

## Development

### Setup Development Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/edurdias/flux
cd flux
poetry install
```

### Run Tests
```bash
poetry run pytest
```

### Code Quality
The project uses several tools for code quality:
- Ruff for linting and formatting
- MyPy for type checking
- Pytest for testing
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
