    "Perfumes are a part of our everyday lives—whether it’s a subtle floral hint or a bold, spicy statement, most people have a signature scent that others come to recognize them by. But have you ever wondered what’s actually in your favorite fragrance? Perfumes are complex mixtures of countless molecules, and each one plays a unique role in shaping the scent you love.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can you figure out which molecule is responsible for that special note in your perfume? And once you have a molecule in mind, how do you know if it’s safe, aromatic, or even used in other fragrances?\n",
    "\n",
    "Meet __FRAGRANCEme.py__, — a Python package that helps demystify the chemistry behind your scent. Simply input a molecule, and the tool will tell you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether the molecule is fragrant or toxic\n",
    "- Its key physical properties, such as boiling point\n",
    "- How it evaporates over time, via an evaporation model\n",
    "- And best of all, which perfumes (when data allows) contain that exact molecule\n",

    "Unlock the secrets behind the scents — one molecule at a time.\n",
