Summary: PERFUMEme is a pip-installable package for analysis of odorous molecules giving main properties. It checks if the molecule has a smell,is toxic for the skin and simulates its evaporation trace. Finally, it indicates in which famous perfumes the molecule is present and eventually its odor.

 - Python Package for analysis of odorous molecules giving main properties

## ‚öõÔ∏è  Package description

PERFUMEme is a Python package designed to evaluate the suitability of molecules for use in perfumes. Combining cheminformatics, volatility modeling, and cosmetic safety criteria, it helps determine whether a compound has an odor, is safe for skin contact, and evaporates at a rate consistent with fragrance formulation (top, heart, or base note). It also tells in which famous perfumes the molecule is present.

Whether you're a fragrance formulator, a cosmetic chemist, or simply curious about scent molecules, PERFUMEme brings together data from PubChem and evaporation theory to support informed and creative olfactory design.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Installation 



## üî• Usage

```python
from mypackage import main_func

# One line to rule them all
result = main_func(data)
```

This usage example shows how to quickly leverage the package's main functionality with just one line of code (or a few lines of code). 
After importing the `main_func` (to be renamed by you), you simply pass in your `data` and get the `result` (this is just an example, your package might have other inputs and outputs). 
Short and sweet, but the real power lies in the detailed documentation.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Installation

Create a new environment, you may also give the environment a different name. 

```
conda create -n perfume_package python=3.10 
```

```
conda activate perfume_package
(conda_env) $ pip install .
```

If you need jupyter lab, install it 

```
(perfume_package) $ pip install jupyterlab
```


## üõ†Ô∏è Development installation

Initialize Git (only for the first time). 

Note: You should have create an empty repository on `https://github.com:mlacrx/perfume-package`.

```
git init
git add * 
git add .*
git commit -m "Initial commit" 
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:mlacrx/perfume-package.git 
git push -u origin main
```

Then add and commit changes as usual. 

To install the package, run

```
(perfume_package) $ pip install -e ".[test,doc]"
```

### Run tests and coverage

```
(conda_env) $ pip install tox
(conda_env) $ tox
```
