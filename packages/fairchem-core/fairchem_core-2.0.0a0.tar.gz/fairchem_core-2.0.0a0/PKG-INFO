</h4>

`fairchem` is the [FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/) Chemistry's centralized repository of all its data, models, demos, and application efforts for materials science and quantum chemistry.

`fairchem` provides training and evaluation code for tasks and models that take arbitrary
chemical structures as input to predict energies / forces / positions / stresses,
and can be used as a base scaffold for research projects. For an overview of
tasks, data, and metrics, please read the documentations and respective papers:
 - [OC20](https://fair-chem.github.io/core/datasets/oc20.html)
 - [OC22](https://fair-chem.github.io/core/datasets/oc22.html)
 - [ODAC23](https://fair-chem.github.io/core/datasets/odac.html)

## Acknowledgements

- This codebase was initially forked from [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn)
by [Tian Xie](http://txie.me), but has undergone significant changes since.
- A lot of engineering ideas have been borrowed from [github.com/facebookresearch/mmf](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mmf).
- The DimeNet++ implementation is based on the [author's Tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/klicperajo/dimenet) and the [DimeNet implementation in Pytorch Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/torch_geometric/nn/models/dimenet.py).
