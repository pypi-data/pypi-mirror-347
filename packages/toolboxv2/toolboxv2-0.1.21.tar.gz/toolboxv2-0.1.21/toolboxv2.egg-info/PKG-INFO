# ToolBoxV2 🧰

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ToolBoxV2.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ToolBoxV2)
[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-Buy%20me%20a%20coffee-yellowgreen.svg)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/markinhaus)

A flexible modular framework for tools, functions, and complete applications – deployable locally, on the web, or as a desktop/mobile app.

---

## 🔍 Overview

ToolBoxV2 combines a Python backend library with a Rust web/desktop server (Actix) and a cross-platform UI framework (Tauri + tbjs). This architecture enables the creation of versatile applications accessible through various interfaces.

![ToolBoxV2 Architecture](architecture-diagram.svg)

---

## 🎯 Goal

The primary goal of ToolBoxV2 is to provide a flexible platform that enables developers, end-users, and small to medium-sized businesses to efficiently create, customize, and use applications. It aims to:
*   Execute applications seamlessly.
*   Integrate diverse functionalities.
*   Ensure system-independence.

The underlying system, built on a monolithic modular architecture, combines the advantages of both approaches, enabling intuitive interaction with the digital world. It connects various components and provides utility functions accessible from anywhere. This platform promotes creative collaboration and eases access to digital resources.

---

## 🎯 Target Audiences & Use Cases

### 👩‍💻 For Developers

Utilize ToolBoxV2 as a framework to:
*   Create custom functions, widgets, or complete mini-applications.
*   Leverage existing modules (`mods`) or extend them with new components.
*   Build web, desktop, or mobile applications using a unified code stack (Python, Rust, Web Technologies).
*   Customize the user interface via the web frontend (tbjs).

### 🙋 For End Users

Access and use a variety of pre-built applications and functions:
*   Directly in a web browser, or as a native desktop/mobile application (powered by Tauri).
*   No prior technical knowledge required.
*   Access flexible tools for tasks such as calendar management, note-taking, image diffusion, quote generation, etc.
*   Personalize the user interface to meet individual needs.

### 🏢 For Businesses / Operators

Deploy ToolBoxV2 as a customizable internal management system for:
*   Self-hosted and highly adaptable solutions.
*   Project, process, or employee management.
*   Integration of proprietary modules and functions.
*   Scalability suitable for small to medium-sized enterprises.
*   Modular, API-ready, and easily extensible.

## 🚀 Installation

We offer several ways to install ToolBoxV2, choose the one that best suits your needs!

### 🥇 Recommended: Zero the Hero Universal Installer (Easiest)

This is the recommended method for most users on **Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL or Git Bash)**. The "Zero the Hero" script intelligently handles Python installation (if needed), sets up a dedicated virtual environment, installs ToolBoxV2 Core, and makes the `tb` command available.

1.  **Download the installer:**
    ```bash
    # Using curl
    curl -sSL -o install_toolbox.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkinHaus/ToolBoxV2/refs/heads/master/installer.sh
    # Or using wget
    wget -qO install_toolbox.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkinHaus/ToolBoxV2/refs/heads/master/installer.sh
    ```
2.  **Make it executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x install_toolbox.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the installer:**
    ```bash
    ./install_toolbox.sh
    ```

4.  **Follow on-screen instructions.** The script will:
    *   ✅ Check for and offer to install required Python version (default: 3.11).
    *   ✅ Create an isolated environment for ToolBoxV2 (usually in `~/.local/share/ToolBoxV2` or `~/Applications/ToolBoxV2`).
    *   ✅ Install ToolBoxV2 Core using `pip` by default.
    *   ✅ Expose the `tb` command (usually via a symlink in `~/.local/bin/`).
    *   🎉 Run `tb -init` to finalize setup.

    **Customization:**
    The script accepts optional arguments (e.g., `--version=0.5.0`, `--source=git`, `--manager=uv`, `--isaa`, `--dev`). If no arguments are given, it looks for an `init.config` file in the same directory. For details, run:
    ```bash
    ./install_toolbox.sh --help
    ```

---

### 💻 Advanced / Alternative Methods

#### 1. Python Package (Direct Installation)

For users who prefer to manage their Python environments manually.

**Using `pip`:**
```bash
    # Ensure you have Python 3.11 and pip installed
    # Recommended: Create and activate a virtual environment first!
    # python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

    pip install ToolBoxV2
    # To install with optional extras (e.g., isaa, dev):
    # pip install "ToolBoxV2[isaa,dev]"
```

**Using `uv` (a fast Python package installer & resolver):**
```bash

    uv pip install ToolBoxV2
    # To install with optional extras:
    # uv pip install "ToolBoxV2[isaa,dev]"
```

After installation with pip or uv, you may need to initialize ToolBoxV2 manually:
```bash
    tb -init
```
Ensure the directory containing the `tb` script (e.g., `~/.local/bin` for user installs, or your venv's `bin` directory) is in your system's `PATH`.

#### 2. From Source (For Developers / Bleeding Edge)

If you want to contribute or use the very latest (potentially unstable) code:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MarkinHaus/ToolBoxV2.git
    cd ToolBoxV2

    # IMPORTANT: Set up and activate a Python virtual environment
    # Example using Python's built-in venv:
    # python3 -m venv .venv
    # source .venv/bin/activate
    #
    # Example using uv:
    # uv venv .venv --python 3.11 # or your desired Python version
    # source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install in editable mode:
    echo "Choose your preferred installation method:"

    echo "  Option A: Using pip"
    echo "    pip install -e \".[dev,isaa]\"  # Install with dev and isaa extras"
    echo "    # or just: pip install -e ."

    echo "  Option B: Using uv"
    echo "    uv pip install -e \".[dev,isaa]\" # Install with dev and isaa extras"
    echo "    # or just: uv pip install -e ."

    # Your existing script for Python environment setup (if it offers more specific dev setup):
    # If you have specific Python dev environment needs beyond a simple venv, you can use:
    # chmod +x install_python_env.sh
    # ./install_python_env.sh

    # Initialize Git hooks (for contributors)
    bash .github/hooks/setup_hooks.sh

    # Initialize ToolBoxV2
    tb -init
```

### 📦 Platform-Specific Installers (Desktop Application)

If ToolBoxV2 includes a bundled desktop application, look for platform-specific installers (e.g., `.dmg`, `.exe`, `.deb`, `.rpm`) on our [**GitHub Releases Page**](https://github.com/MarkinHaus/ToolBoxV2/releases).

These installers typically bundle everything needed and provide a native installation experience.

1.  Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/MarkinHaus/ToolBoxV2/releases).
2.  Download the appropriate installer for your operating system (e.g., `simple-core_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg` for macOS, `simple-core_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe
` for Windows).
3.  Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

### 🖥️ Full Stack Desktop/Web Application (Tauri + Web)

This setup includes the Python backend, Rust server, and Tauri/Web frontend.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.11 or higher
*   [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
*   Tauri CLI: `cargo install tauri-cli`

for execution details use [package.json](toolboxv2/package.json)
or run tb --help

---


## 🧪 CI/CD & Deployment

Automated processes are managed using GitHub Actions for:
*   🔁 **Build & Test**: Validating both Rust and Python components.
*   🚀 **Release**: Publishing to PyPI, building Tauri applications, and potentially Docker images.
