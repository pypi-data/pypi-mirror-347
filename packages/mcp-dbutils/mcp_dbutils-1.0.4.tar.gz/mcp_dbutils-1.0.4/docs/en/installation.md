This document provides simple, easy-to-follow steps to install and configure MCP Database Utilities, allowing your AI assistant to safely access and analyze your databases.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol that allows AI applications (like Claude) to use external tools. MCP Database Utilities is one such tool that enables AI to read your database content without modifying any data.

## Before You Begin

Before starting the installation, please ensure you have:

- An MCP-compatible AI application (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
- At least one database you want the AI to access (SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL)

## Choose Your Installation Method

We offer four simple installation methods. Choose the **ONE** that works best for you:

| Installation Method | Best For | Advantages |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Option A: Using uvx** | Most users | Simple and quick, recommended |
| **Option B: Using Docker** | Users who prefer containerized apps | Isolated environment |
| **Option C: Using Smithery** | Claude Desktop users | One-click installation, easiest |
| **Option D: Offline Installation** | Users in environments without internet | No network connection needed |

## Option A: Using uvx (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install the uv tool

**On Mac or Linux**:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**On Windows**:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

After installation, verify it's working by typing this command in your terminal:
```bash
uv --version
```
You should see something like `uv 0.5.5` in the output.

### Step 2: Create a database configuration file

1. Create a file named `config.yaml` on your computer
2. Copy the following content into the file (choose the one that matches your database type):

**SQLite Database Example**:
```yaml
connections:
  my_sqlite:
    type: sqlite
    path: C:/path/to/your/database.db
```

**PostgreSQL Database Example**:
```yaml
connections:
  my_postgres:
    type: postgres
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    dbname: my_database
    user: postgres_user
    password: postgres_password
```

**MySQL Database Example**:
```yaml
connections:
  my_mysql:
    type: mysql
    host: localhost
    port: 3306
    database: my_database
    user: mysql_user
    password: mysql_password
```

> Please replace the example information with your actual database details. For more configuration options, see the [Configuration Guide](configuration.md).

### Step 3: Configure your AI application

#### Claude Desktop Configuration

## Verifying Your Installation

After completing the installation, let's verify that everything is working correctly:

### Testing the Connection

1. Open your AI application (Claude Desktop or Cursor)
2. Ask your AI: **"Can you check if you're able to connect to my database?"**
3. If configured correctly, the AI will respond that it has successfully connected to your database

### Try Simple Commands

Once connected, you can try these simple commands:

- **"List all tables in my database"**
- **"Describe the structure of the customers table"**
- **"Query the top 5 most expensive products in the products table"**

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: AI Cannot Find the uvx Command

**Symptom**: AI responds with "uvx command not found" or similar error

**Solution**:
1. Confirm uv is properly installed: Run `uv --version` in your terminal
2. If installed but still getting errors, it might be an environment variable issue:
   - On Windows, check if the PATH environment variable includes the uv installation directory
   - On Mac/Linux, you might need to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`

### Issue 2: Cannot Connect to Database

**Symptom**: AI reports it cannot connect to your database

**Solution**:
1. **Check if your database is running**: Make sure your database server is started
2. **Verify connection information**: Carefully check the host, port, username, and password in your config.yaml
3. **Check network settings**:
   - If using Docker, for local databases, use `host.docker.internal` as the hostname
   - Confirm that firewalls are not blocking the connection

### Issue 3: Configuration File Path Error

**Symptom**: AI reports it cannot find the configuration file

**Solution**:
1. **Use absolute paths**: Make sure you're using complete absolute paths in your AI application configuration
2. **Check file permissions**: Ensure the configuration file is readable by the current user
3. **Avoid special characters**: Don't use special characters or spaces in the path, or use quotes if necessary

### Issue 4: SQLite Database Path Problems

**Symptom**: Connection fails when using SQLite

**Solution**:
1. **Check file path**: Make sure the SQLite database file exists and the path is correct
2. **Check permissions**: Ensure the database file has read permissions
3. **When using Docker**: Make sure you've correctly mapped the SQLite file path

## Updating to the Latest Version

Regular updates provide new features and security fixes. Choose the update method that matches your installation method:

### Option A (uvx) Update

When you run MCP Database Utilities using the `uvx` command (e.g., `uvx mcp-dbutils`), it automatically uses the latest version without requiring manual updates.

If you're using the traditional installation method (not the `uvx` command), you can update manually with:

```bash
uv pip install -U mcp-dbutils
```

### Option B (Docker) Update

1. Get the latest project code:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```
   Or download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/donghao1393/mcp-dbutils/releases)

2. Rebuild your Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t mcp/dbutils .
   ```

### Option C (Smithery) Update

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli update @donghao1393/mcp-dbutils
```

### Option D (Offline) Update

1. Download the latest version of the source code in an environment with internet access
2. Replace the source code files in your offline environment

## Example Interactions

After successful installation, you can try these example conversations:

**You**: Can you list all tables in my database?

**AI**: Let me check your database. Here are the tables in your database:
- customers
- products
- orders
- inventory

**You**: What does the customers table look like?

**AI**: The customers table has the following structure:
- id (integer, primary key)
- name (text)
- email (text)
- registration_date (date)
- last_purchase (date)

**You**: How many customers made purchases in the last month?

**AI**: Let me run a query to find out... According to the data, 28 customers made purchases in the last month. The total value of these purchases was $15,742.50.
