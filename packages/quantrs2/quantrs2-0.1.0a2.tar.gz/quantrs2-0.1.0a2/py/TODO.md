## Implementation Notes

- PyO3 type conversion still has overhead for large state vectors
- Generic implementations would be better than fixed-size enum pattern
- Python packaging with native dependencies needs careful consideration
- GPU feature should be made easier to install for Python users
- ML modules should leverage PyTorch when available for hybrid models
- Stub module provides fallback functionality when native code fails

## Known Issues

- Limited to specific qubit counts (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16)
- Run method has significant code duplication due to type limitations
- GPU support requires compilation from source with specific flags
- Large memory requirements for simulating many qubits
- Some ML features have placeholder implementations
- ML modules may have performance bottlenecks compared to native code

## Integration Tasks

- [ ] Improve integration with Python quantum ecosystem
- [ ] Create automated tests using pytest
- [ ] Add benchmarks comparing to other Python quantum frameworks
- [ ] Create conda recipe for easier installation with binary dependencies
- [ ] Develop tutorials for quantum machine learning
- [ ] Create integration examples with scikit-learn
- [ ] Develop domain-specific examples (HEP, finance, chemistry)
- [ ] Create Jupyter notebook gallery for common tasks
