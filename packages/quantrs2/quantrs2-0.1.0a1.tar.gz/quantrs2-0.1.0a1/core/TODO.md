# QuantRS2-Core Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plans and future tasks for the QuantRS2-Core module.

## Current Status

### Completed Features

- âœ… Type-safe qubit identifier implementation
- âœ… Basic quantum gate definitions and trait
- âœ… Register abstraction with const generics
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling system
- âœ… Prelude module for convenient imports

### In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Extended gate support (specialized gate optimizations)
- ðŸ”„ Improved documentation and examples

## Planned Enhancements

### Near-term (v0.1.x)

- [ ] Add specialized trait for parametric gates (rotation gates)
- [ ] Implement gate composition operations
- [ ] Add convenience methods for common gate operations
- [ ] Expand test coverage for edge cases

### Medium-term (v0.2.x)

- [ ] Add support for custom gate definitions with code generation
- [ ] Implement gate decomposition algorithms
- [ ] Create visualizations for quantum gates and states
- [ ] Support for hybrid classical-quantum operations

### Long-term (Future Versions)

- [ ] Support for continuous variable quantum computing
- [ ] Optimized matrix operations for large gate sets
- [ ] Advanced error models and noise characterization
- [ ] Integration with quantum hardware abstraction layer

## Implementation Notes

- Consider adding compile-time gate validation for efficiency
- Potential for using const evaluation for gate matrices in the future
- Matrix storage could be optimized for specific gate types

## Known Issues

- None currently

## Integration Tasks

- [ ] Ensure complete compatibility with circuit builder API
- [ ] Provide optimized implementations for simulator modules
- [ ] Create bridge for device-specific gate implementations
