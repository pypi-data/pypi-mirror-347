- [ ] Add circuit visualization with matplotlib integration
- [ ] Improve documentation with Sphinx and Read the Docs
- [ ] Add more Python examples and Jupyter notebooks
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline for PyPI package
- [ ] Implement full manylinux wheel building
- [ ] Add noise model support in Python interface
- [ ] Enable conditional operations in Python API

### Medium-term (v0.2.x)

- [ ] Add NumPy integration for result processing
- [ ] Create pandas DataFrame converters for results
- [ ] Implement circuit serialization to/from JSON
- [ ] Add device connectivity through Python interface
- [ ] Create visualization tools for hardware execution results
- [ ] Add tensor network simulation support
- [ ] Implement quantum algorithm building blocks
- [ ] Create quantum algorithm library with pre-built circuits

### Long-term (Future Versions)

- [ ] Create comprehensive visualization library
- [ ] Add integration with qiskit and other Python frameworks
- [ ] Implement hardware-specific optimizations in Python interface
- [ ] Create high-level API for quantum algorithm development
- [ ] Add machine learning integrations (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- [ ] Implement distributed simulation capabilities
- [ ] Create interactive web-based visualization and exploration

## Implementation Notes

- PyO3 type conversion still has overhead for large state vectors
- Generic implementations would be better than fixed-size enum pattern
- Python packaging with native dependencies needs careful consideration
- GPU feature should be made easier to install for Python users

## Known Issues

- Limited to specific qubit counts (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16)
- Run method has significant code duplication due to type limitations
- GPU support requires compilation from source with specific flags
- Large memory requirements for simulating many qubits

## Integration Tasks

- [ ] Improve integration with Python quantum ecosystem
- [ ] Create automated tests using pytest
- [ ] Add benchmarks comparing to other Python quantum frameworks
- [ ] Create conda recipe for easier installation with binary dependencies
