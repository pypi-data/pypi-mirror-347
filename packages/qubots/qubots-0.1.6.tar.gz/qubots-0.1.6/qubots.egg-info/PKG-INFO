           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Qubots is a Python library that turns optimization problems and optimization algorithms (optimizers) into shareable, modular “qubots”. The github organization, called Rastion (https://rastion.com), currently serves as a central repository system.

## Installation

Qubots is available on PyPI. To install, simply run:

```bash
pip install qubots
```

## Getting Started

Here’s a brief example showing how to load a problem and a optimizer from the Rastion hub, then run the optimization:

```python
from qubots.auto_problem import AutoProblem
from qubots.auto_optimizer import AutoOptimizer

# TSP from the Rastion GitHub repository.
problem = AutoProblem.from_repo("Rastion/traveling_salesman_problem")

# Optimizer that uses ortools to solve the TSP
ortools_optimizer = AutoOptimizer.from_repo("Rastion/ortools_tsp_solver")

# Run the optimization and print results.
best_solution, best_cost = optimizer.optimize(problem)
print("Best Solution:", best_solution)
print("Best Cost:", best_cost)
```

## Technical Overview

### Base Classes

At the core of qubots are two abstract base classes:

- **BaseProblem**
  - Defines the interface for any optimization problem. Every problem qubot must implement:
    - `evaluate_solution(solution) -> float`
      - Computes the objective value (or cost) for a given candidate solution.
    - `random_solution() (optional)`
      - Generates a random feasible solution for the problem. Having this function serves as a starting point for optimizers when initial solution is not given. 

- **BaseOptimizer**
  - Provides the interface for optimization algorithms. Every optimizer qubot must implement:
    - `optimize(problem, initial_solution=None, **kwargs) -> (solution, cost)`
      - Runs the optimization on a given problem, optionally starting from an initial solution.

These interfaces ensure that every qubot—whether problem or optimizer—can be seamlessly interchanged and composed. Splitting problem and optimizer information like this helps us build shareable specialized optimizers for **BaseProblem**. That is, we achieve a many-to-one connection of optimizers to problems.

### Formulations

Formulations are what makes problems versatile for optimizers. Different problems can have many formulations or mathematical representations. Since formulations are variants of problem, thus problems themselves, it makes sense to define them as **BaseProblem**.

A formulation should contain the logic of transforming **BaseProblem** to the formulation we want **and** the logic of decoding a solution from the formulation problem space back to **BaseProblem**. This ensures that for all the optimizers that uses different formulations of the problem, we have a way to compare them in the original **BaseProblem**. `\qubots\formulations` holds some formulations we tried on the TSP.

### Dynamic Qubot Loading: AutoProblem & AutoOptimizer

To encourage modularity and collaboration, qubots can be dynamically loaded from GitHub repositories. This is accomplished using:

- **AutoProblem**
  - Clones (or pulls) a repository from GitHub.
  - Installs required packages (via `requirements.txt`).
  - Reads a `problem_config.json` file that specifies an `entry_point` (formatted as `module:ClassName`) and default parameters.
  - Dynamically imports and instantiates the problem qubot.

- **AutoOptimizer**
  - Follows a similar process using a `solver_config.json` file.
  - Installs required packages (via `requirements.txt`).
  - Merges default parameters with any user-supplied `override_params`.
  - Dynamically loads the optimizer class and returns an instance ready for use.

This design allows developers to share their work as self-contained GitHub repos that anyone can load, test, and incorporate into larger workflows. **Remote execution of python code files, including installing packages via requirements.txt, is not a good practice**. For this reason it is suggested to use Rastion & Qubots in a secure environment using `python -m venv` or `conda create --name my_rastion_env python=3.9`.

## Community & Qubot Cards 

Each qubot problem and optimizer is served with an additional configuration file we call "qubot card". This file helps the **AutoProblem** and **AutoOptimizer** correctly load qubots by telling them which file contains the base class of the qubot. The qubot card is also designed to keep metadata for helping the **community** better share their work and better organize it on the website where we show all the repositories.
