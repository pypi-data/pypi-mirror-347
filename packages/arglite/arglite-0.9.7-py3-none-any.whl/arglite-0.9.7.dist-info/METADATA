=======
arglite
=======

A lightweight, dynamic argument parsing library for Python programs with klugy support for typing variables.

I made this for a teaching machine project I'm working on (I needed a custom argument parser for _reasons_),
and I'm always too impatient to use `argparse`.

Notes
=====
Flags with no value are automatically converted to `True` boolean
The module uses `ast.literal_eval`, so `"{'a':'b'}"` will convert to a `dict` (all quotes required)    
Programs will produce error messages when flags are missing
