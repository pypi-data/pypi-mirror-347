# nbcat

`nbcat` let you preview Jupyter notebooks directly in your terminal. Think of it as `cat`, but for `.ipynb` files.

## Features

- Very fast and lightweight with minimal dependencies.
- Preview remote notebooks without downloading them.
- Enable paginated view mode with keyboard navigation (similar to `less`).
- Supports image rendering (some protocols in beta)
- Supports for all Jupyter notebook versions, including old legacy formats.

## Motivation

The idea of previewing notebooks in a terminal is not new - there have been many previous attempts to achieve it.  
However, most are either slow and overengineered with a ton of half-working features, or they're outdated and incompatible with modern Python.

I was looking for a simple tool that let me quickly render Jupyter notebooks without switching context from my terminal window or installing a ton of dependencies.  

Please note, that `nbcat` doesn't aim to replace JupyterLab. If you need a full-featured terminal experience, I recommend checking out [euporie](https://euporie.readthedocs.io/) instead.


## Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install nbcat

# Install via Homebrew
brew tab akopdev/formulas/nbcat
brew install nbcat
```

## Quickstart

```bash
$ nbcat notebook.ipynb
```

You can pass URLs as well.

```bash
$ nbcat https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akopdev/nbcat/refs/heads/main/tests/assets/test4.ipynb
```

Example use case with `fzf` command that lists all `.ipynb` files and uses `nbcat` for previewing them:

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.ipynb" | fzf --preview 'nbcat {}'
```

## Testing & Development

Run the tests:

```bash
make test
```

Check code quality:

```bash
make format lint
```
