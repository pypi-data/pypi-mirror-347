# Try decrypting with a wrong key
wrong_key = engine.generate_key("Cryptographic key? :D...", xbase=9)  # Changed "!" to "?"
decrypted_wrong = engine.decrypt(decoded, wrong_key, xbase=9)
if decrypted_wrong != original:
    print("Cannot Decrypt with Wrong Key!")

# Try engine saving
data = engine.save()

## Key Features in Detail

### Ultra-Secure Multi-Key System
v6 retains v5’s optimized multi-key system, ensuring key order matters (5 keys = 1 unique combination, not 120 permutations). The `encrypts` and `decrypts` methods deliver this at near-v5 speed (0.004149s for 50 keys). New key generation options (`generate_key_fast`, `generate_key_net`, `generate_key_big`) allow users to balance speed and security based on use case (e.g., `generate_key_fast` for IoT, `generate_key_big` for banking).

### Message Authentication Code (MAC) Tagging
`add_mactag` and `check_mactag` ensure data integrity by appending and verifying Blake2b-based tags. This detects tampering in transit or storage, making v6 ideal for secure communications in finance, healthcare, and messaging. For example, a bank can use MAC tags to verify transaction integrity.

### Secure Database Engine
`LeCatchu_Database` provides double-encrypted storage (global and cell keys) with MAC-tagged integrity. Methods like `set`, `get`, `getall`, `search`, `save`, and `load` support robust data management. It’s perfect for storing sensitive data, such as user credentials or medical records, with built-in security.

### Password Security Validation
`PassSecurityCheck` checks credentials against GitHub-hosted breach lists, identifying weak passwords like "password123". This empowers developers to enforce strong credentials, reducing vulnerabilities in user-facing applications like login systems.

### Chaos Mode Encryption
The experimental chaos mode (`chaos_seed`, `chaos_coding_unicode_range`) dynamically generates sboxes, adding unpredictable entropy via `__chaos_cached_blake2b` and `chaos_multi`. This is a forward-thinking feature for high-security research, such as experimental blockchain protocols.

### Advanced Data Transformations
Methods like `text_to_binary`, `text_to_ascii`, `text_to_hex`, and `text_to_freq` enable format conversions (e.g., "A" → "01000001" for binary). These are invaluable for educational projects (teaching data representation), debugging (analyzing encoded data), and data analysis (frequency analysis).

### Seed Combination for Exponential Security
`seed_combine` merges multiple keys into a single, ultra-secure key through pairwise interleaving. For three keys (key1, key2, key3), it produces a key with a length proportional to `len(key1)*len(key2)*len(key3)`. For example, three 10-character keys could yield a key thousands of characters long, making brute-force attacks infeasible. This is ideal for multi-party encryption or high-security key derivation.

### Industry-Standard Encryption Suite
`EncryptionStandart_Engine` supports AES, RSA, Blowfish, DES3, ChaCha20, ARC4, and CAST, allowing hybrid operation. Users can leverage LeCatchu’s chaotic algorithms for experimental use or switch to standards for compliance-driven applications (e.g., PCI-DSS).

### Kid-Friendly Encryption Interface
`LeCatchu_Kid_Engine` simplifies cryptography with MAC-tagged security, stronger keys (`xbase=9`), and a performance-optimized sbox (`unicode_support=256`). It’s designed for educational settings, enabling students to explore cryptography safely and intuitively.

### Chaotic Entropy
With an entropy score of **16.520527**, v6’s encrypted data is a cryptographic fortress, exhibiting extreme randomness that defies pattern analysis. This makes it nearly impossible to reverse-engineer, ideal for high-stakes applications.

### Packet-Based Encoding Efficiency
Customizable `coding_for_packet_perlength` (default: 4) optimizes data for network transmission, reducing size with compact combinations. This is critical for real-time applications like secure messaging, IoT, or streaming.

### Robust Hash Algorithm
Blake2b, accelerated by `@lru_cache`, delivers fast, collision-resistant hashing. Per-character rehashing in `hash_stream` ensures unpredictable key streams, even under prolonged use, protecting against replay attacks.

### Advanced Serialization
`lestr2` and `leval2` provide secure, injection-proof serialization for complex data types (lists, dictionaries, sets, booleans, bytes). This ensures versatility for applications requiring structured data, such as configuration files or API payloads.

### Flawless UTF-8 and Unicode Support
Customizable Unicode support (default: 1114112) and robust `encode_direct`/`decode_direct` methods ensure seamless handling of diverse character sets with zero data loss, even in multilingual environments.

### Save/Load Functionality
`save` and `load` persist engine state in JSON format with version checking, enabling reusable configurations. This is a game-changer for long-running applications like servers or cloud services.

### Lightweight and Scalable Architecture
Optimized loops, `@lru_cache`, and memory-efficient structures make v6 a lightweight yet scalable solution, capable of handling embedded devices to high-throughput servers.

### PyPI Accessibility
Install with `pip install lecatchu` ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lecatchu)) for instant access, complete with automatic dependency management (PyCryptodome, lzma). This makes v6 accessible to developers worldwide, from hobbyists to enterprises.

### Shh 🤫 Look Here

Spotted the mysterious `xbase` in LeCatchu?  

That’s your *key to the keys*.  

Set `xbase = 1`, and you’re swimming in **vigintillions** of unique keys. Wild, right?  

Now crank it to `xbase = 50`.  
You’re no longer in a pool of `10^63` keys—you’re diving into an ocean of **`10^512`** values.  
That’s *effectively infinite* in the software universe.  

Picture this: **500 multi-keys**, each with `xbase = 50`, combined using `seed_combine`, stored in a **LeCatchu_Database**, protected with **MAC tags**, and validated by **PassSecurityCheck**.  
Congrats—you’ve crafted a crypto system so chaotic, entropy itself bows down.  

**xbase** is the engine of uniqueness.  
**seed_combine** is the architect of complexity.  
**LeCatchu_Database** is the vault of security.  
**PassSecurityCheck** is the guardian of strength.  
And the best part?  
> LeCatchu v6 doesn’t just secure data—it redefines the boundaries of cryptographic possibility. 😎
