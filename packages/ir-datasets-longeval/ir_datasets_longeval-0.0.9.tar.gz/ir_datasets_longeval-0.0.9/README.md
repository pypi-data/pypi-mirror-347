# ðŸ’¾ ir-datasets-longeval

Extension for accessing the [LongEval](https://clef-longeval.github.io/) datasets via [ir_datasets](https://ir-datasets.com/).


## Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```shell
pip install ir-datasets-longeval
```

## Usage

The `ir_datasets_longeval` extension provides an `load` method that returns a LongEval `ir_dataset` that allows to load official versions of the LongEval datasets as well as modified versions that you have on your local filesystem:

```python
from ir_datasets_longeval import load

# load an official version of the LongEval dataset.
dataset = load("longeval-web/2022-06")

# load a local copy of a LongEval dataset.
# E.g., so that you can easily run your approach on modified data.
dataset = load("<PATH-TO-A-DIRECTORY-ON-YOUR-MACHINE>")

# From now on, you can use dataset as any ir_dataset
```

LongEval datasets have a set of temporal specifics that you can use:

```Python
# At what time does/did a dataset take place?
dataset.get_timestamp()

# Each dataset can have a list of zero or more past datasets/interactions.
# You can incorporate them in your retrieval system:
for past_dataset in dataset.get_prior_datasets():
    # `past_dataset` is an LongEval `ir_dataset` with the same functionality as the `dataset`
    past_dataset.get_timestamp()
```


If you want to use the [CLI](https://ir-datasets.com/cli.html), just use the `ir_datasets_longeval` instead of `ir_datasets`. All CLI commands will work as usual, e.g., to list the officially available datasets:

```shell
ir_datasets_longeval list
```

## Development

To build this package and contribute to its development you need to install the `build`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` packages (pre-installed on most systems):

```shell
pip install build setuptools wheel
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```shell
python3.10 -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Dependencies

Install the package and test dependencies:

```shell
pip install -e .[tests]
```

### Testing

Verify your changes against the test suite to verify.

```shell
ruff check .                   # Code format and LINT
mypy .                         # Static typing
bandit -c pyproject.toml -r .  # Security
pytest .                       # Unit tests
```

Please also add tests for your newly developed code.

### Build wheels

Wheels for this package can be built with:

```shell
python -m build
```
