How to get started
==================


Read the documentation
-------------------------

You should probably start with the :ref:`examples` section.
This collection of examples will gradually be completed
to cover almost all features of the library.

Some of the modules that are special or of particular interest
are described in the :ref:`uses` section.


Using the library
-----------------

Like most xarray-based projects, xoa provides not only a
a :ref:`library <api>` but also :ref:`accessors <accessors>` for convenient access to part of the
access to part of the functionality.
Both uses are demonstrated in the practical examples.
