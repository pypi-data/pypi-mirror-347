# Text-to-Speech (TTS) Simple (by HMCorp)

This repository provides a simple implementation of a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system. It allows users to generate speech audio files (e.g., `.wav`) from text input. The project is designed to be lightweight and easy to use.

## Features
- Convert text input into `.wav` audio files.
- Cross-platform support for macOS and Windows.
- Easy setup and usage.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

### macOS
1. Install Python:
    ```bash
    brew install python
    ```
2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HMCorp-Fund/tts_simple.git
    cd tts_simple
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Install additional dependencies for `.wav` file generation:
    ```bash
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```

### Windows
1. Install Python:
    Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
    Ensure you check the box to add Python to your PATH during installation.
2. Clone the repository:
    ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tts_simple.git
    cd tts_simple
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```cmd
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Install additional dependencies for `.wav` file generation:
    Download and install FFmpeg from [FFmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/). Add the FFmpeg binary to your system PATH.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python tts_simple.py --text "Hello, world!" --output output.wav
    ```
    Replace `"Hello, world!"` with your desired text and `output.wav` with your desired output file name.

2. Example:
    ```bash
    python tts_simple.py --text "This is a test." --output test.wav
    ```

## Dependencies
The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech)
- `pydub` (for audio processing)
- `ffmpeg` (for `.wav` file generation)

Install these dependencies via:
```bash
pip install gTTS pydub
```

## Notes
- Ensure FFmpeg is correctly installed and added to your PATH for `.wav` file generation.
- The script is designed for educational purposes and may require additional tuning for production use.
