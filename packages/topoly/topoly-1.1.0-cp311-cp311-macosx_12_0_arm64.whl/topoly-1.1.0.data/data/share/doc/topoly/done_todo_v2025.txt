DONE:
- maxGLN: fast (n^3 instead n^4) and accurate computations
- huge amount of fixes and updating for new versions of Python, Mac etc
- Windows

ALMOST DONE (to be added to topoly / fixed...):
? - Homfly, new dictionaries
- AlexanderTuzin - way faster knot recognition
- Yamada - Bartek's fast version with translating PD to Gauss
? - generating thetas, handcuffs (it was... but what we were working with Bartek on in grant?)
- knot core 
- drawing diagrams from Bostjan - Patryk

TO DO:
- AlexanderTuzin - fix: Unknot != Unknown != Error (W+P)
- Homfly, new dictionaries (Wojtek)
- add new yamada to topoly (Bartek), eventually also Bostjan's version / completing translating PD to Gauss (check if it is available) (Bartek)
- benchmark of yamada implementations (Bartek/Wanda) 
- slow loading of a dictionary? (Bostjan+somebody) (tests and maybe loading big dictionaries only when we first need them - problems with multiprocessing)
- add knotcore (Bartek/Wanda)

- compilation on Mac (PATRYK ma!), new numpy, Python and so on (Pol & all.....)

- topoly/codes.py: pdcodes of thetas - Bostjan can repair order of edges in 3-valent vertices (they aren't always folowwing the same rule)


POSSIBLY:
- Reading RNA
- knots in knots

PAPER:
- Bostjan+Wanda+the rest


mail 14.07.2023 "Topoly":

TODO	by whom?
HOMFLY library of 2 component links up to 10 crossings	Wojtek
Yamada library up to 10 crossings	Bartek
Add knotcore and tests	Bartek
Modify C++ Alexander output so errors do not return 0 polynomial	Wanda
Pull to the top functions for creating pdcode/emcode, closure, KMT	Bartek
Accumulation of knot probabilities	Wandy licencjuszka + Wanda?
Work with RNA pdb/cif files	
Trajectory analysis	
Find loops etc.	Bartek
