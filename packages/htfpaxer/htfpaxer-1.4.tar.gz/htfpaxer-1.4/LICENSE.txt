All rights reserved -- for now.
I am deep into code and don't have the time to write up all legal mumbo jumbo for current moment.
I will do it later.

Current permissions:
- You CAN install it into your system and use it as-is.
- You CAN show the original version to some dudes "Hey! look at this shit I found!"
- For personal non-commercial purposes: do what the hell you want.
- Any other rights are reserved, ez? or just ask me.

it can be installed via pip using this command:
pip install htfpaxer

or just yoink this shit from github and install it locally, whatever..
