# EntroPy Password Generator v0.5.1

**Release Date**: May 11, 2025

## Overview
The **EntroPy Password Generator** v0.5.1 is now available on [Test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/entropy-password-generator/) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/entropy-password-generator/)! This release enhances the CLI output formatting for better readability, updates project documentation, and prepares for the stable PyPI release (v0.5.1). It includes 20 secure password generation modes, with entropies from 97.62 to 833.00 bits, exceeding ProtonÂ© and NIST standards.

## What's New
- **Enhanced CLI Output**: Added blank lines before and after the `Password` field in the CLI output, improving visual separation between `Custom Password` (or `Mode X Password`), `Password`, and `Length` fields for all modes (1-20 via `--mode`) and custom configurations (15-128 characters via `--length`).
- **Updated Documentation**: Refreshed the "Screenshots" section in `README.md` with new images hosted on Google Drive, showcasing the updated password output layout for Mode 15 (`python3 entropy_password_generator/password_generator.py --mode 15`) and a custom configuration with `--length 85` (`python3 entropy_password_generator/password_generator.py --length 85`).
