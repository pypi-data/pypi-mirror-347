# Release v2.0.0

**Release Date:** March 29, 2025

## ðŸš€ Major Framework Changes

- **Migration from Pyomo to Linopy**: Completely rebuilt the optimization foundation to use Linopy instead of Pyomo
    - Significant performance improvements, especially for large models
    - Internal useage of linopys mathematical modeling language
- **xarray-Based Data Architecture**: Redesigned data handling to rely on xarray.Dataset throughout the package for:
    - Improved solution representation and analysis
    - Enhanced time series management
    - Consistent serialization across all elements
    - Reduced file size and improved performance
- **Saving and restoring unsolved Models**: The FlowSystem is now fully serializable and can be saved to a file.
    - Share your work with others by saving the FlowSystem to a file
    - Load a FlowSystem from a file to extend  or modify your work

## ðŸ”§ Key Improvements

### Model Handling

- **Extend every flixopt model with the linopy language**: Add any additional constraint or variable to your flixopt model by using the linopy language.
- **Full Model Export/Import**: As a result of the migration to Linopy, the linopy.Model can be exported before or after the solve.
- **Improved Infeasible Model Handling**: Added better detection and reporting for infeasible optimization models
- **Improved Model Documentation**: Every model can be documented in a .yaml file, containing human readable mathematical formulations of all variables and constraints. THis is used to document every Calculation.

### Calculation Results and documentation: 
The `CalculationResults` class has been completely redesigned to provide a more streamlined and intuitive interface.
Accessing the results of a Calculation is now as simple as:
```python
fx.FullCalculation('Sim1', flow_system)
calculation.solve(fx.solvers.HighsSolver())
calculation.results  # This object can be entirely saved and reloaded to file without any information loss
```
This access doesn't change if you save and load the results to a file or use them in your script directly!

- **Improved Documentation**: The FlowSystem as well as a model Documentation is created for every model run.
- **Results without saving to file**: The results of a Calculation can now be properly accessed without saving the results to a file first.
- **Unified Solution exploration**: Every `Calculation` has a `Calculation.results` attribute, which accesses the solution. This can be saved and reloaded without any information loss.
- **Improved Calculation Results**: The results of a Calculation are now more intuitive and easier to access. The `CalculationResults` class has been completely redesigned to provide a more streamlined and intuitive interface.

### Data Management & I/O

- **Unified Serialization**: Standardized serialization and deserialization across all elements
- **Compression Support**: Added data compression when saving results to reduce file size
- **to_netcdf/from_netcdf Methods**: Added for FlowSystem and other core components

### Details
#### TimeSeries Enhancements

- **xarray Integration**: Redesigned TimeSeries to depend on xr.DataArray
- **datatypes**: Added support for more datatypes, with methods for conversion to TimeSeries
- **Improved TimeSeriesCollection**: Enhanced indexing, representation, and dataset conversion
- **Simplified Time Management**: Removed period concepts and focused on timesteps for more intuitive time handling

## ðŸ“š Documentation

- Improved documentation of the FlixOpt API and mathematical formulations
- **Google Style Docstrings**: Updated all docstrings to Google style format

## ðŸ”„ Dependencies

- **Linopy**: Added as the core dependency replacing Pyomo
- **xarray**: Now a critical dependency for data handling and file I/O
- **netcdf4**: Dependency for fast and efficient file I/O

### Dropped Dependencies
- **pyomo**: Replaced by linopy as the modeling language

## ðŸ“‹ Migration Notes

This version represents a significant architecture change. If you're upgrading:

- Code that directly accessed Pyomo models will need to be updated to work with Linopy
- Data handling now uses xarray.Dataset throughout, which may require changes in how you interact with results
- The way labels are constructed has changed throughout the system
- The results of calculations are now handled differently, and may require changes in how you access results
- The framework was renamed from flixOpt to flixopt. Use `import flixopt as fx`.

## Installation

```bash
pip install flixopt==2.0.0
```

## Upgrading

```bash
pip install --upgrade flixopt
```
