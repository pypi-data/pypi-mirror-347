# Release v2.0.1

**Release Date:** 2025-04-10

## Improvements

* Add logger warning if relative_minimum is used without on_off_parameters in Flow, as this prevents the flow_rate from switching "OFF"

## Bug Fixes

* Replace "|" with "__" in filenames when saving figures, as "|" can lead to issues on windows
* Fixed a Bug that prevented the load factor from working without InvestmentParameters
