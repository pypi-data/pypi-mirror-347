# JAXFlow

**JAXFlow** is a high-level neural network library built on top of [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and [Optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax), inspired by the simplicity and elegance of TensorFlow/Keras.

It brings intuitive model-building, training, and evaluation tools to the JAX ecosystem â€” without compromising flexibility or performance.
