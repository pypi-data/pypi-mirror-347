from pyqpanda.Hamiltonian import PauliOperator
def hamiltonian_operator_overload():
    """
    Constructs two Pauli operators from predefined operator dictionaries and demonstrates their usage.

    This function initializes two Pauli operators, `m1` and `m2`, using predefined operator mappings. It then prints the initial state of both operators,
    adds `m2` to `m1`, rearranges the operators to a specified order, and prints the final state of `m1`.

    The Pauli operators are defined as follows:
    - `m1` is constructed with the operators: {'X2 z1 y3 x4': 5.0, "z0 X2 y5": 8}
    - `m2` is constructed with the operators: {'X2 z0 y3 x4 y1': -5}

    The function is intended for use within the pyQPanda package, which facilitates programming quantum computers and quantum circuits.
    It operates on a quantum circuit simulator or a quantum cloud service.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        None

    Example:
        >>> hamiltonian_operator_overload()
        PauliOperator({'X2 z1 y3 x4': 5.0, 'z0 X2 y5': 8})
        PauliOperator({'X2 z0 y3 x4 y1': -5})
        PauliOperator({'X2 z1 y3 x4': 0.0, 'z0 X2 y5': 8, 'X2 z0 y3 x4 y1': -5})
    """
    op_dict={'X2 z1 y3 x4':5.0, "z0 X2 y5":8}
    op_dict2={'X2 z0 y3 x4 y1':-5}

    m1=PauliOperator(op_dict)
    m2=PauliOperator(op_dict2)
    print(m1)
    print(m2)
    m1+=m2
    m1.arrange()
    print(m1)
