✨ Imagine a world where AI agents collaborate effortlessly and securely—no passport 🚫, no boundaries 🌐.

That’s Pebbling 🐧.An open source, secured protocol fo agent to agent communication.

🚀 Powered by Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) 🔑, secured conversations with mutual TLS (mTLS) 🔒, and a lightweight yet powerful communication protocol built on JSON-RPC 2.0 ⚡️—Pebbling is paving the way for the next generation of collaborative AI systems. 🌟🤖


## 🌟 Features

Pebbling helps your AI agents talk to each other seamlessly:

🔒 **Super Secure** - Your agents exchange secrets safely (with built-in mTLS)

🧩 **Plug-and-Play** - Just decorate your agent and it's ready to communicate

⚡ **Lightning Fast** - Quick connections without the weight

🌐 **Works Everywhere** - Connect any agents, regardless of their programming language

🔄 **Reliable Communication** - Messages always arrive correctly and in order


## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Using pip
pip install pebbling

# Using uv (recommended)
uv add pebbling
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Pebblify an Agent

```python
from pebbling import pebblify

# Define your agent
class MyAgent:
    def say_hello(self):
        return "Hello, Agent!"

# Pebblify your agent
pebblify(MyAgent())

# You're now ready to communicate securely between agents!
```

### Pebblify a [Agno](https://github.com/agno-ai/agno) Agent

```python
from pebbling import pebblify
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Define your agent
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
)

# Pebblify your agent
pebblify(agent)

# You're now ready to communicate securely between agents!
```
