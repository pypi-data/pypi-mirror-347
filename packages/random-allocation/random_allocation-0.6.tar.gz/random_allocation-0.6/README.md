# Random Allocation for Differential Privacy

This package provides tools for analyzing and comparing different random allocation schemes in the context of differential privacy.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install random-allocation
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the package to run experiments:

```python
from random_allocation import run_experiment, PlotType
from random_allocation import ALLOCATION, ALLOCATION_ANALYTIC, ALLOCATION_DIRECT, ALLOCATION_DECOMPOSITION

# Define experiment parameters
params_dict = {
    'x_var': 'sigma',
    'y_var': 'epsilon',
    'sigma': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5],
    'n': 1000,
    'k': 10,
    'delta': 1e-5
}

# Define configuration
config_dict = {
    'title': 'Sigma vs Epsilon',
    'x name': 'Sigma',
    'y name': 'Epsilon'
}

# Define visualization configuration
visualization_config = {
    'log_x_axis': False,
    'log_y_axis': True
}

# Define methods to compare
methods = [ALLOCATION_ANALYTIC, ALLOCATION_DIRECT, ALLOCATION_DECOMPOSITION]

# Run the experiment
run_experiment(
    params_dict=params_dict,
    config_dict=config_dict,
    methods=methods,
    visualization_config=visualization_config,
    experiment_name='sigma_vs_epsilon',
    plot_type=PlotType.COMPARISON,
    save_data=True,
    save_plots=True
)
```

## Creating Custom Experiments

To create your own experiments:

1. Create a new Python file (e.g., `my_experiments.py`)
2. Import the necessary functions and constants from `random_allocation`
3. Define your experiment parameters, configuration, and methods
4. Call `run_experiment` with your settings

The package provides two types of plots:
- `PlotType.COMPARISON`: For comparing different methods
- `PlotType.COMBINED`: For showing combined results

## Testing

The project includes a test suite to ensure code functionality is maintained during refactoring. The tests are located in the `tests` directory and can be run using:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover tests

# Run a specific test file
python -m unittest tests.basic_tests
```

The test suite includes basic "smoke tests" for all main functions, ensuring they run without errors when given reasonable parameters. If you're refactoring code, run these tests to make sure you haven't broken any functionality.

For more information about the test suite, see [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).

## Available Methods

The package includes several methods for comparison:
- `ALLOCATION_ANALYTIC`: Our analytic method
- `ALLOCATION_DIRECT`: Our RDP-based method
- `ALLOCATION_DECOMPOSITION`: Our decomposition method
