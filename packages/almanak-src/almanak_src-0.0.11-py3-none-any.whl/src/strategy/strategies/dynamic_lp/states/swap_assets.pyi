    Executes the necessary asset swaps to maintain the desired token ratio to open a new position based

    Will only swap in the direction of the token that needs to be increased to reach the desired ratio.

    Args:
        strat (StrategyDynamicLP): The Strategy instance.

    Returns:
        ActionBundle or None: An ActionBundle containing the approve and swap actions if a swap is needed.

    Notes:
        - Swaps are done in the pool in which we are LPing. A better routing will be implemented.
