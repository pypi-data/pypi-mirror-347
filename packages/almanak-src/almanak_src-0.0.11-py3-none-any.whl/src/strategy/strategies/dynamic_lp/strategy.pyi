        Executes the strategy by progressing through its state machine based on the current state.

        This method orchestrates the transitions between different states of the strategy,
        performing actions as defined in each state, and moves to the next state based on the
        actions' results and strategy's configuration.

            dict: A dictionary containing the current state, next state, and actions taken or
                recommended, depending on the execution mode.

            ValueError: If an unknown state is encountered, indicating a potential issue in state management.

        Notes:
            - This method is central to the strategy's operational logic, calling other methods
            associated with specific states like initialization, rebalancing, or closing positions.
            - It integrates debugging features to display balances and positions if enabled.
