def open_position(strat: StrategyDynamicLP) -> ActionBundle:

    Opens a new liquidity position based on the current market conditions and strategy settings.

    This function calculates the amounts to be used for the new position from the tokens available
    after close & swaps then determines the price bounds for the position based on current market price
    and strategy-defined volatility.

    Args:
        strat (StrategyDynamicLP): The Strategy instance.

    Returns:
        ActionBundle: A bundle of actions including token approvals and the open/mint transaction.

    Notes:
        - Bounds are in human readable prices, not in ticks. The conversion is done in the SDK.

    TODO: Need to support for other model. Currently implicitly assuming volatility model.

    Calculate the LP Position based on given parameters.

    Args:

        include_last_swap_amounts (bool): Whether to include the amounts from the last swap when calculating available capital.
        use_specified_amounts (bool, optional): If True, use the specified `amount0` and `amount1` instead of calculating based on available capital. Defaults to False.
        amount0 (int, optional): The specified amount of token0 to use for the position. Ignored if `use_specified_amounts` is False. Defaults to 0.
