PyHarmX is a PyTorch module designed for efficient [polyharmonic spline interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyharmonic_spline). Leveraging GPU acceleration, this implementation excels in performance, making it well-suited for large-scale interpolation tasks.

## Installation

Install PyHarmX using the following command:

```bash
pip install pyharmx
```

PyHarmX has minimal dependencies, requiring only PyTorch and NumPy.

If you're interested in contributing or want to use PyHarmX in developer/editable mode with test dependencies, install it as follows:

```bash
pip install -e pyharmx[test]
```

To run the tests, simply execute:

```bash
pytest <path-to-pyharmx>
```
