## üîß How It Works

Tacz combines local language models with a sophisticated command database to deliver accurate, contextual terminal commands:

### Database Architecture
- **SQLite Storage**: All commands and history are stored locally in SQLite
- **Full-Text Search**: Uses SQLite's FTS5 virtual tables for efficient natural language queries
- **Tag System**: Commands are tagged for semantic matching even when exact wording differs

### Command Retrieval
1. **Hybrid Search**: First attempts database lookups before calling the LLM
2. **OS Awareness**: Filters commands by your OS (Linux/macOS/Windows)
3. **Popularity Ranking**: Frequently used commands are prioritized in results

### LLM
- **JSON Parsing**: Processes LLM responses with multiple fallback mechanisms for reliability
- **Command Learning**: New commands discovered via LLMs are stored in the database for future use

### Safety Mechanisms
- **Pattern Detection**: Uses regex patterns to identify potentially dangerous operations
- **Command Breakdown**: Analyzes command components to help users understand what they're running
- **Interactive Confirmation**: Requires explicit approval before executing risky commands

## üìã Prerequisites

### System Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **RAM** | 8GB | 16GB+ |
| **Python** | 3.9+ | 3.11+ |
| **Disk Space** | 2GB free | 5GB+ free |
| **OS** | Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, Linux | Any recent version |

Note: If you're using M1 chips or any older models, `llama` models will be slow

### Model Requirements

Different models have different memory requirements:

| Model | Size | RAM Required | Speed |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| `phi3:mini` | 1.8GB | 4GB | Fast ‚ö° |
| `llama3.1:8b` | 4.7GB | 8GB | Balanced ‚öñÔ∏è |
| `llama3.1:70b` | 40GB | 64GB | Slow but powerful üß† |

## üîß Installation

### Quick Install

1. Choose your AI engine

Pick one (Ollama is recommended):

##### ollama 
```bash
Ollama (Easy):

# macos
brew install ollama

# linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

##### llama.cpp

```bash
# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
make server
```

2. Start your ai engine

##### ollama 
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
ollama serve

# Terminal 2: Download model
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

#### for llama.cpp
```bash
# Download a model
curl -L -o model.gguf [HUGGINGFACE_MODEL_URL]

# Start server
./server -m model.gguf
```

### Install tacz

```bash
pip install tacz

tacz --setup
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Direct query
tacz 'find all python files'

# Interactive mode
tacz

# Show command history
tacz --history

# Show favorite commands
tacz --favorites
```

## üåü Key Improvements

- **Everything runs locally** - No API keys, no internet required
- **Enhanced safety** - Multiple layers of dangerous command detection
- **Command history** - Track and search your commands
- **Favorites system** - Save your most-used commands
- **Better prompts** - Category-specific templates for better responses
- **Command editing** - Edit commands before execution
- **Database-powered storage** - Command history and preferences stored in SQLite

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `~/.taczrc` to customize:
```
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
ENABLE_CACHE=true
CACHE_TTL_HOURS=24
ENABLE_HISTORY=true
ENABLE_SAFETY_CHECKS=true
```

## üéØ Recommended Models

For best results:
- `llama3.1:8b` - Great balance of speed and accuracy
- `phi3:mini` - Faster, smaller model
- `mistral:latest` - More creative suggestions
- `codellama:7b` - Specialized for code and commands

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- Pattern matching for dangerous commands
- Command editing before execution
- Explicit warnings for risky operations
- Whitelist validation for basic commands
- Command history tracking

## üìù Examples

```bash
# File operations
tacz 'show hidden files'
tacz 'delete empty directories recursively'

# System information
tacz 'check memory usage'
tacz 'find large files over 100MB'

# Git operations
tacz 'show git branches sorted by date'
tacz 'undo last commit but keep changes'

# Docker operations
tacz 'list running containers with exposed ports'
tacz 'clean up unused docker resources'
```

## üîí Data & Privacy

Tacz is designed with a local-first approach to ensure your data never leaves your machine:

### Data Flow

1. **Initial Setup**: When you first run Tacz, a SQLite database is created in your home directory (`~/.tacz/commands.db`)

2. **Command Preloading**: The database is populated with a curated set of common terminal commands from our bundled data files

3. **Command Generation**: When no matching commands are found in the database:
   - Your query and system context are sent to your local Ollama instance
   - Generated commands are stored in your database for future reuse
   - No data is ever sent to external servers

4. **Learning from Usage**: As you use Tacz:
   - Commands you execute get a higher "popularity" score
   - Favorites you save are tagged for easier retrieval
   - Command history is recorded locally for your reference

### Database Contents

Your local SQLite database contains:

- **Commands**: Terminal commands with explanations and safety ratings
- **Tags**: Semantic labels for improved command retrieval 
- **History**: Your command usage history (what you ran and when)
- **Favorites**: Commands you've explicitly saved

All of this data remains entirely on your machine and can be inspected or deleted at any time by accessing the database file at `~/.tacz/commands.db`.
