  description: >
    This dataset examines how variations in injection molding parameters affect screw driving 
    performance in plastic housing assemblies. We systematically modified production parameters 
    of the upper workpiece including glass fiber content, recyclate content, switching point, 
    injection velocity, and mold temperature. These variations simulate real-world manufacturing 
    fluctuations and material batch changes commonly encountered in production environments. 
    The dataset includes 2400 total observations across 42 distinct experimental conditions.
  purpose: >
    To analyze how injection molding parameter variations impact screw driving metrics, providing 
    insights for quality control measures in plastic component production and assembly processes,
    as well as the detectability of material and process variations through fastening data analysis.
