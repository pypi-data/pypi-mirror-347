  description: > 
    This dataset examines how different surface conditions affect screw driving 
    performance. We tested various surface modifications including wear, lubrication, 
    surface treatments, and contamination to create realistic scenarios encountered 
    in manufacturing environments. The dataset includes 12,500 total observations 
    across 8 distinct surface conditions.
  purpose: > 
    To analyze how different surface conditions impact screw driving metrics, 
    providing insights for quality control measures and optimal manufacturing parameters 
    under varying surface friction scenarios.
