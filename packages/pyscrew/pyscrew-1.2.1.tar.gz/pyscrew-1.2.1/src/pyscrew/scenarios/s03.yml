  description: >
    This dataset examines how different screw and component faults affect screw driving
    performance. We tested various fault conditions including washer modifications, 
    thread deformations, interface interferences, structural modifications, and 
    alignment issues to create realistic fault scenarios encountered in manufacturing 
    environments. The dataset includes 1800 total observations across 26 distinct 
    experimental conditions.
  purpose: >
    To analyze how different fault conditions impact screw driving metrics, providing insights 
    for quality control measures and fault detection capabilities under varying screw driving 
    failure scenarios.
