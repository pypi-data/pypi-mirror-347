"""
Field definitions for screw operation data.

This module contains dataclasses that define the field names used throughout the PyScrew package:
1. JSON fields: Raw data as found in the JSON measurement files
2. CSV fields: Metadata and classification information from labels.csv
3. Output fields: Standardized field names used in the processing pipeline output

These constants provide a centralized reference for accessing data consistently
throughout the codebase and help maintain a clear separation between raw input data
and processed output data.

@dataclass
class JsonFields:
    """
    Constants for field names in the JSON files containing screw operation data.

    These classes define the naming conventions used in the raw JSON data files
    from the screw driving control system. The field names preserve the original
    structure and naming conventions from the source data.

    Note: The string values (e.g. "id code", "time values") are pre-defined by
    the screw driving control and cannot be changed. Our constant names use a
    more consistent style and align with the CSV field naming (e.g., mapping JSON's
    "result" to WORKPIECE_RESULT to match the CSV's "workpiece_result" field).

        Run-level metadata fields in the JSON.

        These fields describe the overall properties of a complete screw operation run
        and are found at the top level of each JSON file.

        Attributes:
            ID: Unique cycle number as recorded by the screw station
            DATE: Timestamp when the run was performed

        Step-level metadata fields in the JSON.

        These fields describe individual steps within a screw operation run.
        A typical operation consists of four steps: finding, thread forming,
        pre-tightening, and final tightening.

        Attributes:
            NAME: Step identifier (e.g., "Finding", "Thread Forming")

        Measurement field names in the JSON graph data.

        These field names preserve the space-based naming convention from the
        raw JSON data.

        Attributes:
            TIME: Time measurements (0.0012s increments) recording when each measurement was taken

            The raw data also includes "angleRed values" and "torqueRed values" which are
            always [0,...,0] and are not used in processing.

            STEP and CLASS fields are added during later processing and are not
            present in the raw JSON data.

            We need to keep the spaces in these names to match the raw data structure.

class OutputFields:
    """
    Field names for the processed output data structure.

    This class defines standardized field names for the output data structure
    that is produced by the processing pipeline. It represents the transformation
    from raw space-based JSON field names to more standard underscore-based
    Python naming conventions.

    The output fields encompass three types of data:
    1. Transformed measurement data from the raw JSON
    2. Derived fields calculated during processing
    3. Metadata fields from the CSV labels file

    This provides a unified and consistent interface for accessing all
    data fields in the pipeline output, regardless of their source.
