  description: >
    This dataset examines how different screw and component faults affect screw driving
    performance. We tested various fault conditions including thread modifications,
    surface conditions, component modifications, material variations, and process parameter
    changes to create realistic fault scenarios encountered in manufacturing environments.
    The dataset includes 5000 total observations across 25 distinct experimental conditions,
    recorded over a compressed two-week period. Unlike s03, control group data was recorded
    in alternating sequence with error data (5 OK followed by 5 NOK observations) to
    minimize environmental condition influences.
  purpose: >
    To analyze how different fault conditions impact screw driving metrics, providing insights
    for quality control measures and fault detection capabilities under varying screw driving
    failure scenarios. The experimental design with five distinct groups of 24 errors and
    interleaved control samples enables more robust analysis of error patterns by reducing
    temporal bias compared to s03. The knowledge gained from s03 directly informed these
    methodological improvements, resulting in a dataset with higher consistency and reduced
    confounding variables.
