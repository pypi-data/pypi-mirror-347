"""
Core data model for screw data analysis.

This module implements a hierarchical data structure for analyzing screw operations:

ScrewDataset
    └── ScrewRun (multiple)
        └── ScrewStep (multiple)
            └── contains measurements (like time, torque, angle, gradient) and a "step" to track origin

The data comes from two sources:
1. JSON files: Contain measurement data and step information
2. CSV file: Contains metadata and classification information
