MoaT-Box
########

This module manages boxes, i.e. things you can put other things into.

"Box" is meant to be inclusive. A room is a box. So is a cupboard, or a row
of books. Boxes can be nested, with locations.

Boxes are typed. You can put a cupboard into a room but not vice versa.

Boxes are labelled. A box can have an arbitrary number of labels, though
most of the time it'll have one, or at most two: one with a barcode and a
box number, one with a text that describes the content, or at least reminds
the owner of it.
