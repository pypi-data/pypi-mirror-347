class ContactBaseModel(BaseModel):
    """
    Base model for contact information in the Naxai People API.
    
    This class defines the common structure for contact objects returned by various
    contact-related API endpoints. It contains essential contact information and
    communication preferences.
    
    Attributes:
        nx_id (str): The unique Naxai identifier for the contact.
            Mapped from JSON key 'nxId'.
        email (Optional[str]): The contact's email address.
            Defaults to None if not provided.
        phone (Optional[str]): The contact's phone number.
            Defaults to None if not provided.
        sms_capable (Optional[bool]): Whether the contact's phone can receive SMS messages.
            Mapped from JSON key 'smsCapable'. Defaults to None if not provided.
        external_id (Optional[str]): An external identifier for the contact, typically
            from your own system. Mapped from JSON key 'externalId'.
            Defaults to None if not provided.
        unsubscribed (Optional[bool]): Whether the contact has unsubscribed from communications.
            Defaults to None if not provided.
        language (Optional[str]): The contact's preferred language code (e.g., "en", "fr").
            Defaults to None if not provided.
        created_at (Optional[int]): Timestamp when the contact was created in your system.
            Mapped from JSON key 'createdAt'. Defaults to None if not provided.
        created_at_naxai (Optional[int]): Timestamp when the contact was created in Naxai.
            Mapped from JSON key 'createdAtNaxai'. Defaults to None if not provided.
    
    Example:

        - The model allows extra fields beyond those explicitly defined, which can
          include custom attributes specific to the contact
        - Custom attributes will be accessible as dynamic properties on the model instance

    Model representing an export job in the Naxai People API.
    
    This class defines the structure for export jobs, which are used to export data

    processed asynchronously and can be monitored for completion.
    
    Attributes:
        id (str): The unique identifier of the export job.

            Defaults to None.

            Currently only "Contacts" or "contacts" is supported. Defaults to None.
        state (Optional[Literal["pending", "done", "failed"]]): The current state of the export job.
            - "pending": The export is being processed
            - "done": The export has completed successfully
            - "failed": The export encountered an error

class ListExportsResponse(BaseModel):
    """
    Response model for listing export jobs in the Naxai People API.
    
    This class represents the response returned by the API when retrieving a list of
    export jobs. It implements list-like behavior, allowing the response to be used
    as an iterable collection of export objects.
    
    Attributes:
        root (list[Export]): The list of export job objects returned by the API.

    Note:
        - This class implements __len__, __getitem__, and __iter__ methods to provide
          list-like behavior
        - The model_validate_json method handles both array-style JSON and object-style
          JSON with a root field
        - When a JSON array is provided, it's automatically wrapped in a 'root' field
        - The class uses Pydantic's default_factory to initialize the root as an empty
          list when no data is provided

    Response model for retrieving the download URL of a completed export in the Naxai People API.

    Attributes:

    Response model for creating a new export job in the Naxai People API.
    
    This class represents the response returned by the API when a new export job is

    Attributes:
        pagination (Pagination): Pagination information about the contacts being exported,
            including the total number of contacts and page information.
        contacts (list[ContactBaseModel]): A preview list of contacts that will be included

    Note:
        - This response provides a preview of the contacts that will be exported
        - The pagination information indicates the total number of contacts in the export
        - Unlike GetExportResponse, this doesn't contain the export job ID directly
        - You may need to extract the export ID from headers or other response metadata
        - Export jobs are processed asynchronously and may take time to complete
        - After creating an export, you should periodically check its status using the get method
        - Once the export is complete, you can retrieve the download URL
