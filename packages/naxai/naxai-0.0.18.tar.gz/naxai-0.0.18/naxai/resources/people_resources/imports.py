        Retrieve a list of import jobs from the Naxai People API.
        
        This method fetches all import jobs in your account, allowing you to view
        and track the status of current and past imports.
        
        Returns:
            ListImportsResponse: A response object containing the list of import jobs.
                The response behaves like a list and can be iterated over.

            NaxaiAuthenticationError: If authentication fails.
            NaxaiAuthorizationError: If the account lacks permission to access imports.

            can be used to calculate progress
            - The mapping field provides information about how columns in the import file
            were mapped to attributes in Naxai
            - For failed imports, check the failed_reason field for more information
            - Import jobs remain accessible even after completion for historical reference
