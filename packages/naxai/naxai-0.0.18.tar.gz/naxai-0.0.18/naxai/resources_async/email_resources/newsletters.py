        Note:
            - Only include fields that need to be updated in the request; omitted fields will remain unchanged
            - Adding a scheduled_at timestamp to a draft newsletter will change its state to "scheduled"
            - Setting scheduled_at to None for a scheduled newsletter will change its state back to "draft"
            - Once a newsletter has been sent (state="sent"), most fields cannot be updated
            - When updating content, ensure you use the correct source type:
            * For source="html", provide the updated HTML in the body field
            * For source="editor", provide the updated design in the body_design field
            - Changing the source type (from "html" to "editor" or vice versa) requires providing
            the appropriate content field (body or body_design)
            - The state transition rules are:
            * draft -> scheduled (when scheduled_at is set)
            * scheduled -> draft (when scheduled_at is removed)
            * draft/scheduled -> sent (when the newsletter is sent, either manually or automatically)
            - The modified_at and modified_by fields will be updated to reflect this change
            - The preview URL can be used to view the updated newsletter in a browser

            - Typically, only newsletters in "draft" state can be deleted
            - Newsletters in "scheduled" state may need to be unscheduled first (by updating with scheduled_at=None)
            - Newsletters in "sent" state often cannot be deleted due to record-keeping requirements
            - After deletion, any attempt to access the newsletter using its ID will result in an error
            - This method is useful for cleaning up unused or outdated draft newsletters
            - Consider archiving important newsletters instead of deleting them if they may be needed for reference
