# MCP Functions Agent Example

This example shows a "math" Agent using manually-defined functions to compute simple math results for a user request.

The agent will determine, based on the request, which functions to call and in what order.

To run the example (after setting openai api_key in mcp_agent.secrets.yaml):
`uv run scripts/example.py run functions --debug`
