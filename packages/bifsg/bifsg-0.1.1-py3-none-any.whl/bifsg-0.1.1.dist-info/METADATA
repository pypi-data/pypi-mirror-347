# bifsg

Bayesian Improved First-Firstname Surname Geocoding (BIFSG) Python package.


This package is a realization of the Bayesian Improved First Name Surname Geocoding (BIFSG) method published by Ioan Voicu, U.S Department of Treaury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. https://doi.org/10.1080/2330443X.2018.1427012

Census tract - https://www.ffiec.gov/censusapp.htm Source: FFIEC Census Flat Files 2020 The FFIEC Census flat files are a convenient method of accessing and analyzing the FFIEC census data that are used to create the HMDA and CRA Aggregate and Disclosure Reports. They contain over 1,000 fields of census data and are updated annually to reflect changes to MSA/MD boundaries announced by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and CRA Distressed/Underserved Census Tracts as announced by the Federal banking regulatory agencies.

These six categories are consistent with the categories used in the Census Bureau's surname list. (2017-11-14) Author: Tzioumis, Konstantinos (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency)
