from ansible_vault import Vault

vault = Vault('password')
data = vault.load(open('vault.yml').read())
```

When you have to write data, then you can write data to file. See below.

```python
from ansible_vault import Vault

vault = Vault('password')
vault.dump(data, open('vault.yml', 'w'))

# also you can get encrypted text
print(vault.dump(data))
```
