Module Name: checkdigit.py

Description: 
    This module provides the `AbstractCheckDigit` class, translating Apache Commons 
    Validatorâ€™s `AbstractCheckDigit.java` into Python. It serves as a base for check 
    digit algorithms, defining the interface for computing and validating check digits.
