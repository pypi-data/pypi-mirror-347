# GameChanger Client for Python

The purpose of this project is to build an easy-to-use wrapper for interacting with the GameChanger APIs.

This will allow various use cases such as automating collection of player stats, videos, or standings.

## [WIP] Authentication

This is still a work in progress as I'm still working on reverse engineering the authentication process for GameChanger.

For now, you'll need to export your GameChanger token as the `GC_TOKEN` environment variable.  If you don't know how to get this, or set it, this project probably isn't for you at the moment.
