        NO LIABILITY
        
        As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or
        condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising

# Cobalt

Cobalt is a toolkit for illuminating and improving AI models and data.


## Why Cobalt?

The time you have to understand and fix your modelâ€™s errors is limited,
expensive and hard to scale to the size of your dataset. Cobalt automates the
otherwise painful step of looking for patterns in how your models are
performing. We're here to make [topological data
analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01236) easy to use.


## Get Started

Create a new virtual environment and install Cobalt with `pip`.

```sh
pip install cobalt-ai
```

Then register your copy of Cobalt by opening a Python shell and running

```python
import cobalt
cobalt.register_license()
```

See the [setup instructions](https://docs.cobalt.bluelightai.com/setup.html) for more details.

## Cobalt

BluelightAI Cobalt illuminates model errors and makes model performance
comparisons easy in Python:

- Easily [start analysis](https://docs.cobalt.bluelightai.com/) for a model or
  dataset with a few lines of code. Cobalt readily supports text, image, and
  tabular datasets.

- Automatically identify problematic groups of data in your model, saving days
  or weeks of troubleshooting effort.

- Quickly compare models and assess the deployment risk of each model for your
  use case. See [here](https://docs.cobalt.bluelightai.com/examples.html) for an example comparing embedding models for product search.

- Use the groups discovered by Cobalt to track the most important metrics for
  model improvement: curate your data, retrain, fine-tune, or develop intuitive
  test cases based on Cobalt's intelligent groups.

- Explore an interactive visualization of your dataset, model errors, or
  embedding model using our TDA-based dimensionality reduction:


## Documentation

See the documentation at [docs.cobalt.bluelightai.com](https://docs.cobalt.bluelightai.com).
