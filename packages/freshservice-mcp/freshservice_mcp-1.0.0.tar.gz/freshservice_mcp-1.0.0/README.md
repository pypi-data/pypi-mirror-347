## Getting Started

### Installing via Smithery

To install freshservice_mcp automatically via Smithery:

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @effytech/freshservice_mcp --client claude
```

### Prerequisites

- A Freshservice account (sign up at [freshservice.com](https://www.freshservice.com))
- Freshservice API key
- `uvx` installed (`pip install uv` or `brew install uv`)

### Configuration

1. Generate your Freshservice API key from the admin panel:
   - Navigate to Profile Settings → API Settings
   - Copy your API key for configuration

2. Set up your domain and authentication details as shown below

### Usage with Claude Desktop

1. Install Claude Desktop from the [official website](https://claude.ai/desktop)
2. Add the following configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "freshservice-mcp": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
        "freshservice-mcp"
    ],
    "env": {
      "FRESHSERVICE_API_KEY": "<YOUR_FRESHSERVICE_API_KEY>",
      "FRESHSERVICE_DOMAIN": "<YOUR_FRESHSERVICE_DOMAIN>"
    }
  }
}
```
**Important**: Replace `<YOUR_FRESHSERVICE_API_KEY>` with your actual API key and `<YOUR_FRESHSERVICE_DOMAIN>` with your domain (e.g., `yourcompany.freshservice.com`)

## Example Operations

Once configured, you can ask Claude to perform operations like:

- "Create a new incident ticket with subject 'Network connectivity issue in Marketing department' and description 'Users unable to connect to Wi-Fi in Marketing area', set priority to high"
- "Update the status of change request #45678 to 'Approved'"
- "List all critical incidents reported in the last 24 hours"
- "Show asset details for laptop with asset tag 'LT-2023-087'"
- "Create a change request for scheduled server maintenance next Tuesday at 2 AM"

## Testing

For testing purposes, you can start the server manually:

```bash
uvx freshservice-mcp --env FRESHSERVICE_API_KEY=<your_api_key> --env FRESHSERVICE_DOMAIN=<your_domain>
```

## Troubleshooting

- Verify your Freshservice API key and domain are correct
- Ensure proper network connectivity to Freshservice servers
- Check API rate limits and quotas
- Verify the `uvx` command is available in your PATH
