class AES(BlockCipher):
    """AES cipher implementation according to FIPS-197.

    AES is a block cipher with block size of 16 bytes. There are three variants of AES with different key lengths and count of rounds:
        * AES-128 - 128-bit (16 bytes) key with 10 rounds
        * AES-192 - 192-bit (24 bytes) key with 12 rounds
        * AES-256 - 256-bit (32 bytes) key with 14 rounds

    This implementation will use appropriate variant according to the size of key passed to the constructor.
    Note that only encrypt() and decyprt() functions are instance-dependent, all other functions are static, and may be used without instantiating the object.
