<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation

To grab the latest stable release simply run

```sh
pip install openscvx
```

to install OpenSCVx in your python environment.

<details>
<summary>Install Development / Nightly Version</summary>

If you want the pre-release version, you can install the latest `nightly` build with:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ --pre --upgrade openscvx
```

This command will also upgrade an existing `nightly` install to the latest version
Or if you want a specific pre-release version this can be installed with

```sh
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ openscvx==1.2.3.dev45
```

where `1.2.3.dev45 => <major>.<minor>.<patch>.dev<XY>` corresponds to your exact version
</details>


#### Dependencies

The main packages are:

- `cvxpy` - is used to formulate and solve the convex subproblems
- `jax` - is used for determining the Jacobians using automatic differentiation, vectorization, and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation of the dynamics and their Jacobians 
- `numpy` - is used for numerical operations
- `diffrax` - is used for the numerical integration of the dynamics
- `termcolor` - is used for pretty command line output
- `plotly` - is used for all visualizations

These will be installed automatically, but can be installed via conda or pip if you are building from source.
<details>
<summary>Via Conda</summary>

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/haynec/OpenSCvx.git
   ```
2. Install environment packages (this will take about a minute or two):
   ```sh
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
3. Activate the environment:
   ```sh
   conda activate los_guidance
   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Via Pip</summary>

0. Prerequisites
   Python >= 3.9
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/haynec/OpenSCvx.git
   ```
2. Install environment packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
</details>

### Running Trajectory Optimization

See `examples/` folder for several example trajectory optimization problems.
To run a problem simply run `examples/main.py` with:

```sh
python3 examples/main.py
```

To change which example is run by `main` simply replace the `problem` import line:

```python
# other imports
from examples.params.dr_vp import problem
# rest of code
```

and adjust the plotting as needed.
Check out the problem definitions inside `examples/params` to see how to define your own problems.

## ToDos

- [X] Standardized Vehicle and Constraint classes
- [X] Implement QOCOGen with CVPYGEN
- [X] Non-Dilated Time Propagation 
- [ ] Auto-SCvx Weight Tuning
- [ ] Compiled at the subproblem level with JAX
- [ ] Save and reload the compiled JAX code
- [ ] Single Shot propagation
- [ ] Unified Mathematical Interface

## What is implemented

This repo has the following features:

1. Free Final Time
2. Fully adaptive time dilation (```s``` is appended to the control vector)
3. Continuous-Time Constraint Satisfaction
4. FOH and ZOH exact discretization (```t``` is a state so you can bring your own scheme)
6. Vectorized and Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiled Multishooting Discretization
7. JAX Autodiff for Jacobians
