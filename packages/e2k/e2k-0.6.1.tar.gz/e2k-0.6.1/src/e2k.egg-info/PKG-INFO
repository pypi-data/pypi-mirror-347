# English to Katakana Translator

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/e2k.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/e2k)


`e2k` is a Python library that translates English to Katakana. It's based on a RNN model trained on a dictionary extracted from Wikitionary and JMdict / EDICT. It only requires `numpy` as a dependency.

We also provide a English to Katakana dictionary in the releases (not available in the PyPI package).

## Usage

`e2k` is available on PyPI.

```bash
pip install e2k
```

Usage:

2 types of models are provided, one converts phoneme to Katakana and one that converts character to Katakana. Choose the one that fits your use case.

```python
from e2k import P2K, C2K
from g2p_en import G2p # any g2p library with CMUdict will work

# cmudict phoneme to katakana
p2k = P2K()

g2p = G2p()

word = "vordhosbn" # track 2 from Aphex Twin's "Drukqs"

word = word

katakana = p2k(g2p(word))

print(katakana) # "ボードヒッチン"

# characters directly to katakana
c2k = C2K()

katakana = c2k(word)

print(katakana) # "ボードホスン"

# we provide top_k and top_p decoding strategies
katakana = c2k(word, "top_k", k=5) # top_k sampling
katakana = c2k(word, "top_p", p=0.9, t=2) # top_p sampling
# see https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/generation_strategies
# for more details

# you can check the accepted symbols using
in_table = c2k.in_table # `c2k` accepts lowercase characters, space and apostrophe
in_table = p2k.in_table # `p2k` accepts phonemes from the CMUdict and space
# for output symbols
out_table = c2k.out_table
out_table = p2k.out_table
```
### Pitch Accent Prediction

We also provide an RNN model for pitch accent prediction. It's trained on about 700k entries from [Unidic](https://clrd.ninjal.ac.jp/unidic/). You can use it independently for any katakana sequences.

```python
from e2k import AccentPredictor as Ap
from e2k import C2K

c2k = C2K()
ap = Ap()

word = "geogaddi"

katakana = c2k(word)

accent = ap(katakana)

print(f"Katakana: {katakana}, Accent: {accent}")
# Katakana: ジオガディ, Accent: 3

# you can also check its in-table
in_table = ap.in_table # it's katakana without special tokens
```
### N-Gram Model

We also provide an N-Gram model to check if an English word suits for pronounciation (for example, not a short-hand word like `MVP` or `USSR`). In such case you may want to spell it as-is.

```python
from e2k import NGram

ngram = NGram()

def isvalid(word)
  valid = ngram(word)
  print(f"Word: {word}, {"Valid" if ngram(word) else "Invalid"}")

isvalid("ussr") # invalid
isvalid("doggy") # valid

# we also provide an util function to spell as-is
word = "ussr"
print(ngram.as_is(word)) # ユーエスエスアール

# A common practice is to spell the word when valid and spell as-is when invalid.
# The example below will print 
# `ユーエスエスアール` for `ussr` instead of `アサー`,
# `ドギー` for `doggy` instead of `ディーオージージーワイ`
if ngram(word):
  print(ngram.as_is(word))
else:
  print(c2k(word))

in_table = ngram.in_table # check the in_table

# you can also check the raw score
score = ngram.score(word) # negative value, higher the better
```

> [!WARNING]
> For any symbols not in the `in_table`, the model will ignore them and may produce unexpected results.

> [!NOTE]
> The model will lower the input word automatically.

## Performance

### Katakana Prediction

We evaluate BLEU score on 10% of the dataset.

| Model | BLEU Score ↑ |
| ----- | ------------ |
| P2K   | 0.89         |
| C2K   | 0.92         |

### Accent Prediction

We evaluate accuracy on 10% of the dataset.

| Model   | Accuracy ↑ |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Default | 88.4%      |

### N-Gram Model

I don't know how to evaluate the n-gram model.

## Katakana Dictionary

We train the model on a dictionary extracted from `Wikitionary` and `JMdict / EDICT`. The dictionary contains 30k entries, you can also find it in the releases.

> [!Note]
> The dictionary is not included in the PyPI package. Either download it from the releases or create it yourself following the instructions below.

### Dependencies

The **extraction script** has zero dependencies, as long as you have a Python 3 interpreter it should work.

However, it's not included in the PyPI package, you need to clone this repository to use it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Patchethium/e2k.git
```

### Download data

#### Wikitionary

Download the raw dump of the Japanese Wikitionary from https://kaikki.org/dictionary/rawdata.html, they kindly provide the parsed data in a JSONL format.

Look for the `Japanese ja-extract.jsonl.gz (compressed 37.5MB)` entry and download it. If you prefer command line, use

```bash
curl -O https://kaikki.org/dictionary/downloads/ja/ja-extract.jsonl.gz
```

#### JMdict / EDICT

Download the `JMdict` and `EDICT` from https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/JMdict-EDICT_Dictionary_Project.

Look for the `edict2.gz` and download it. Or in command line:

```bash
curl -O http://ftp.edrdg.org/pub/Nihongo/edict2.gz
```

Extract both files into `/vendor` folder.

On Linux, you can use

```bash
gzip -d ja-extract.jsonl.gz
gzip -d edict2.gz
```

### Run the extraction

```bash
python extract.py
# if you have another name for the file
python extract.py --path /path/to/your_file.jsonl
```

By default, a `katakana_dict.jsonl` file will be created in the `vendor` folder.

## Accent Dictionary

Go to [Unidic's homepage](https://clrd.ninjal.ac.jp/unidic/back_number.html) and look for entry `unidic-mecab-2.1.2_src.zip` and download.

Or in commandline, `wget https://clrd.ninjal.ac.jp/unidic_archive/cwj/2.1.2/unidic-mecab-2.1.2_src.zip`.

### Extraction

Extract the zip file and place the `lex.csv` into `vendor`.

### Training

To train the accent predictor, simply run

```bash
python accent.py
```

## N-Gram Model

Download [cmudict](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmusphinx/cmudict/master/cmudict.dict), or `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmusphinx/cmudict/master/cmudict.dict`.

### Training

```bash
python ngram.py
```

## Development

### Install the dependencies

I use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the dependencies and publish the package.

```bash
uv sync
```

Then activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` or add `uv run` before the commands.

### Benchmark

The scores in [Performance](#performance) are obtained using the `eval.py` script.

```bash
# --p2k for phoneme to katakana, if not provided, it will be character to katakana
python eval.py --data ./vendor/katakana_dict.jsonl --model /path/to/your/model.pth --p2k
```

### Train

After installing the dependencies, `torch` will be added as a development dependency. You can train the model using

```bash
python train.py --data ./vendor/katakana_dict.jsonl
```

It takes around 10 minutes on a desktop CPU. The model will be saved as `vendor/model-{p2k/c2k}-e{epoch}.pth`.

Also, you'll need to either download the `katakana_dict.jsonl` from the releases or create it yourself using the `extract.py` script.

#### CUDA

The `cpu` version is capable to train this little model, if you prefer to use GPU, use `--extra` to install the `torch` with CUDA support,

```bash
uv sync --extra cu124
# or
uv sync --extra cu121
```

depending on your CUDA version.

### Export

The model should be exported to `numpy` format for production use.

```bash
# --p2k for phoneme to katakana, if not provided, it will be character to katakana
# --fp32 for double precision, by default we use fp16 to save space
# --output to specify the output file, in this project it's `model-{p2k/c2k}.npz`
# --safetenors to use safe tensors, it's for easier binding in some languages
# --accent to extract accent predictor, in this project the model name is `accent.npz`
python export.py --model /path/to/your/model.pth --p2k --output /path/to/your/model.npz
```
