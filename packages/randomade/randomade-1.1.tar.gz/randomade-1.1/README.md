Randomade v1.1
==============

**Randomade** is built using the `random` library, which comes preinstalled with Python.  
It is specifically built for getting random values. Currently, you can get random letters and numbers, both with custom ranges (e.g. between A and T or 3 and 26).

**rand_number**  
The `rand_number` function is for generating a random integer between 2 values (`min_num` and `max_num`).  
The syntax is: `rand_number(min_num, max_num)`  
`min_num` and `max_num` can be any English number.

**rand_letter**  
The `rand_letter` function is for generating a random letter between 2 letters (`min` and `max`).  
The syntax is: `rand_letter(min, max)`  
`min` and `max` can be any English letter.

Fun fact
---------

I wrote all of Randomade v1.0 and v1.1 with a broken right hand in 24 hours with a cast on my arm (I'm right-handed).  
I actually wrote all the `rand_letter` function while waiting for an X-ray in the ER.
