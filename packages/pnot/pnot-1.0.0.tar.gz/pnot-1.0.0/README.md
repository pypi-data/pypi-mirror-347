# PNOT: Python Nested Optimal Transport ðŸª†

This library implements very fast C++ and Python solver for the nested (adapted) optimal transport problem. In particular, it calculates the adapted Wasserstein distance quickly and accurately. We provide both C++ and Python implementations, and a wrapper to use the fast C++ solver from Python. It is very easy to use. Just feed two path samples into the solverâ€”the rest (empirical measures, quantization, nested computation) happens automatically and swiftly.

## Performance Comparison:
We compare **PNOTâ€™s** C++Â `nested_ot` solver against the only publicly available alternativeâ€”`solve_dynamic` from AOTNumerics (Eckstein &Â PammerÂ 2023). For both markovian and non-markovian solver, we obtain more than 3000Ã— speed improvement and the gap widens with larger samples.

## Convergence Analysis:
We test the consistency of our solver as number of samples increases. By choosing the grid size $\Delta_N = N^{-\frac{1}{dT}}$, the adapted 2-Wasserstein distance between adapted empirical measures converge to the theoretical adapted 2-Wasserstein distance between underlying measures, namely $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_2(\hat{\mu}^N, \hat{\nu}^N) \to \mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_2(\mu, \nu)$. This numerically confirm Theorem 2.7 in [1].
