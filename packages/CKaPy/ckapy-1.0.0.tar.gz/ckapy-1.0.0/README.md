# CKaPy

## Description
CKaPy is a Python3 package with personal tools commonly used in my day-to-day as a physics researcher. These tools are not project specific, but instead are used for common data science and visualization purposes. 

## Installation
This package is installable through PyPi with the command:

```Unix
pip install ckapy
```

## Usage
Currently this package contains methods for three primary purposes: returning the current date and time in a formatted string, printing a value with uncertainty, and printing the current progress of an interative loop.
Some of these methods are designed for output from commonly used methods.

## Support
Please submit any issues or short-falls you encounter to GitHub.

## Roadmap
I expect this project to remain fairly small in scope, with tools I used during my Ph.D. but not much more.
