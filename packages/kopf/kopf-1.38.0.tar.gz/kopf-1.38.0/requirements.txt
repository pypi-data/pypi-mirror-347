# Enforce the hotfix for Ubuntu 24.04 in CI. Otherwise, we are stuck in Ubuntu 22.04.
# The bugfix is merged but not released: https://github.com/wbond/oscrypto/issues/78
# Pinning this in the end operators is the decision of the operator developers,
# including the protocols of accessing the repo or vendoring the dependency code.
# The dev-mode dependency is used ONLY with an temporary & insecure self-signed CA for simplicity,
# and ONLY with Ubuntu 24.04+. Therefore, it is not pinned in setup.py (e.g., works fine in 22.04).
# In the worst case, configure the operator with a self-signed CA made in the OpenSSL CLI manually.
