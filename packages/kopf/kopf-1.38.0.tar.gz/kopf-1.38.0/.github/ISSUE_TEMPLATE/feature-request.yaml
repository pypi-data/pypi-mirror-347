      label: Problem
      description: >
        What problem do you currently face so that you want this feature?
        Are there existing features or tools close to solving this problem?
        Why don't they work?
      placeholder: >
        E.g.: I want to access several in-memory indicies anywhere in the code
        nested in multiple levels of function calls. Currently, I have to pass
        the indicies from the handlers down the stack in every call,
        which complicates the code and makes it too wordy.

    attributes:
      label: Proposal
      description: >
        Describe the solution you would like to have.
        Are there any other ways of achieving the same goal?
        Why is this proposal better than those alternatives?
      placeholder: >
        E.g.: Either store the indicies in global variables,
        or pass a single kwarg with all indicies at once,
        not as separate kwargs.

        A code snippet showing the new feature in action, at least as an idea.

        # E.g.:
        import kopf

        my_index = kopf.Index()

        @kopf.index('pods', target=my_index)
        def fn(**_):
            ...

        def any_function():
            for key, val in my_index.items():
                ...
