class Timer:
    ''' Performs precisely timed callbacks
    
        The timer is given a set number of steps which could be frames in a
        video, seconds until an alarm, etc. The timer will count up, calling a
        callback function with each iteration, until the set number of steps is
        reached.

        The callback functions must accept a single integer argument, which is
        the current step.

        The timer works by storing the current time when it is started and
        computing the step of each iteration based on the time elasped since
        the timer started. It is not guaranteed that the callback function will
        be called with exactly sequential steps since step(s) will be skipped
        if the callback function takes longer than expected to execute.

        The number of steps, and the delay between steps can be changed at any
        time (even while the timer is running)
        
        The simplest usage is a stopwatch, where delay could be 1 for seconds or
        0.001 for miliseconds. The callback will be called to increment the time

        ----------

            :param end_callback: function () - called when final step is reached
            :param start_callback: function (current_step) - called when timer is started
            :param stop_callback: function () - called when timer is stopped
            :param skip_callback: function (current_step) - called when step is incremented
            :param min_step: int - lowest allowed step (default=0)
            :param max_step: int - number of steps in timer (default=None - unlimited)
            :param reset_end_start: bool - If True, resets timer when starting from the end
            :param track_execution_time: bool - only use when debugging (more computationally expensive)

        Note
        ----
            * Start, stop, skip, and end callbacks are always called regardless of the
                manner in which the event occurs
            * For example, if you call the Timer.start() method, the start
                callback will be called
            * However, if Timer.start() is called when timer is already running,
                the start callback will not be called
            * Timer.to_end() does not call the skip function since this stops the
                timer
