History

2025.5.14 -- Bugfix: Add references for RDKit
    * Added citations when using RDKit instead of OpenBabel
      
2024.2.24 -- Added isomeric SMILES to structure names and ability to discard structures
    * Added ability to ignore or discard a structure from e.g. optimization
    * Added isomeric SMILES to the possible names for systems and configurations
      
2024.10.31 -- Bugfix: Issue recognizing chemical names
    * Fixed an issue where the chemical name was handled as SMILES, causing the code to
      crash. 
      
2023.11.10 -- Bugfix: New configurations created incorrectly
    * New configurations made from other systems could remove the atoms in those
      systems.
      
2023.11.9.1 -- Removed using structure names when perceiving type
    * Using structure names is too dangerous to use by perceiving if text is a name of
      SMILES and there is no easy test for valid SMILES. So change to only using names
      if the user specifies names.
      
2023.11.9 -- Improved structure handling, added from names
    * Switched to standard structure handling, which adds more options
    * Added getting structures from Pubchem using the chemical name.
      
2023.7.18 -- Added support for InChI and InChIKeys

2021.2.10 (10 February 2021)
----------------------------

* Updated the README file to give a better description.
