# opentf-agent

This package is part of the OpenTestFactory initiative.

## Overview

An agent is a process that runs on an execution environment.  That process will contact the orchestrator at regular intervals, looking for some orders to execute. If there is a pending order, the agent will do as asked and send the result back to the orchestrator.

The agent documentation is part of the
[OpenTestFactory orchestrator](https://opentestfactory.org/guides) documentation, in the **Guides** section.
