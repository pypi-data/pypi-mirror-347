# routix

Routix is a lightweight Python toolkit for designing and executing structured algorithmic workflows.

It provides:

- Subroutine-based execution control (`SubroutineController`)
- Structured flow validation (`SubroutineFlowValidator`)
- Dot-accessible configuration trees (`DynamicDataObject`)
- Logging with routine-context traceability
- Experiment summary and timing support
