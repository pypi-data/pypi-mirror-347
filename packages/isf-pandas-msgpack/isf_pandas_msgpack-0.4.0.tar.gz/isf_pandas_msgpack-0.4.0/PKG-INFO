**pandas-msgpack** is an interface to msgpack for pandas. It allows for convenient IO of common pandas objects to the `msgpack` format, 
including performant compression like `blosc`.

This package is a fork of the original `pandas-msgpack`, which has not been maintained since
its inception in 2017 by the PyData team. However, it is to date an extremely performant dataformat.

We are not the original authors of this package, and we do not claim any ownership of the original code. 
We are simply maintaining and updating it for use in our main project ISF (https://github.com/mpinb/in_silico_framework).
We have no interest in adding new features, or making this broadly applicable. PRs are however very welcome.

## Installation

Install latest release version via pip

```shell
pip install isf-pandas-msgpack
```

## CI

API tests are run on a single OS (`ubuntu-latest`) for all `pandas` versions (`1.1` through `2.2` at the time of writing). 
Python versions are not explicitly tested for, and we let the environment solver determine which Python version is appropriate for the `pandas` version (these turn out to be Python `3.9` through `3.12`)

Building the package is tested for Python versions `>=3.8` on three major platforms: Ubuntu, macOS and Windows (all 64 bit).

## PyPI

Publication to PyPI is triggered upon creating a github release.
For macOS and Linux, only the source distribution is published. `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` have been properly configured with the `setuptools` build backend, so this should not give too much issue.
For Windows, we provide wheels for Python `>=3.8`.
