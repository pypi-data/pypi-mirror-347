Configuration
=============

Make sure the scheduled action (ir.cron) is enabled or create a new one
if you prefer.

Adjust the arguments in the code field of the cron according to your
reminder strategy.

You can use cron arguments to modify three options in this position
(days, near_events, template_id):

- *days*: Change days to limit events search, 7 as default.
- *draft_events*: This is for including draft events also.
- *near_events*: Select an option to include events which begin date is
  between today and limit days, False as default.
- *template_id*: You can select and id template to render as third
  parameter, None by default, so email is rendered with the template
  installed by the module.
- partner_ids: By default, the event is notified to the event
  responsible, but you can choose who to notify indicating in this
  parameter a list of the IDs.
