            recorded_points: The number of points to record the simulation results at (determined automatically by default).
            initial_velocities: The initial velocities of the robot arm joints (defaults to all zeros).
            initial_conditions: The initial conditions of the robot arm as a state vector (optional).
            skip_first: Whether to skip the first recorded point (default is `False`). This is useful
                when combining multiple simulations together, but it's mostly used internally.

            if you are specifying the initial conditions, specifying the initial velocities is no longer necessary
