| Shor      | ~40 MB/s      | ~200 MB/s     | 5x             |
| Hybrid    | ~35 MB/s      | ~180 MB/s     | 5x             |
| Improved  | ~45 MB/s      | ~220 MB/s     | 4.9x           |

## Security Assessment

The improved algorithms show strong resistance to quantum attacks:

| Algorithm | Avalanche Effect | Collision Resistance | Grover Resistance | Shor Resistance |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Enhanced Grover | 49.2% | 99.9% | High | Medium-High |
| Enhanced Shor | 48.7% | 99.8% | Medium-High | High |
| Enhanced Hybrid | 49.5% | 99.9% | High | High |
