# Self-Healing Code Generation Loop: Technical Documentation

This document provides a detailed technical overview of the self-healing code generation loop implementation, including architecture, components, workflows, and integration with Arc Memory and OpenAI.

## Architecture Overview

The self-healing code generation loop is implemented as a multi-agent system that leverages Arc Memory's knowledge graph and OpenAI's agent orchestration capabilities. The system consists of three specialized agents:

1. **Code Review Agent**: Analyzes code quality, patterns, and potential issues
2. **Blast Radius Analysis Agent**: Analyzes potential impacts of changes
3. **Code Generation Agent**: Generates improved code based on insights

These agents are coordinated by an orchestration layer that manages the workflow between them and ensures they share the same knowledge graph context.

## System Components

### 1. Agent Implementations

#### Code Review Agent (`llm_powered_code_review.py`)

- **Purpose**: Analyze code quality, patterns, and potential issues
- **Inputs**: Repository path, file(s) to analyze
- **Outputs**: JSON with code review results, including:
  - File-specific reviews with contextual understanding

- **Outputs**: Improved code with explanations
- **Key Methods**:
  - `generate_improved_code()`: Main code generation function
  - `get_file_content()`: Retrieve file contents
  - `display_results()`: Format and display results

### 2. Orchestration Layer (`self_healing_loop.py`)

- **Purpose**: Coordinate the workflow between agents
- **Inputs**: Repository path, file to improve, iteration count, improvement threshold
- **Outputs**: Final improved code with evaluation
- **Key Methods**:
  - `run_self_healing_loop()`: Main orchestration function
  - `run_code_review_agent()`: Execute the Code Review Agent
  - `run_blast_radius_agent()`: Execute the Blast Radius Analysis Agent
  - `run_code_generation_agent()`: Execute the Code Generation Agent
  - `evaluate_improvement()`: Evaluate the quality of improvements
  - `create_openai_orchestrator()`: Create an OpenAI agent for orchestration

### 3. Knowledge Graph Integration

All agents leverage Arc Memory's knowledge graph through the SDK:

- **Arc Initialization**: Each agent initializes Arc with the repository path
- **Graph Building**: Agents check if a graph exists and build it if needed
- **SDK Methods**: Agents use methods like `query()`, `get_decision_trail()`, `get_related_entities()`, and `analyze_component_impact()`
- **Context Sharing**: All agents access the same knowledge graph for consistent context

### 4. OpenAI Integration

The system integrates with OpenAI through Arc Memory's OpenAI adapter:

- **Adapter Creation**: `get_adapter("openai")` to get the OpenAI adapter
- **Tool Adaptation**: `adapt_functions()` to convert Arc Memory functions to OpenAI tools
- **Agent Creation**: `create_agent()` to create an OpenAI agent with the tools
- **Model Selection**: Uses GPT-4.1 for all agents to leverage its 1M token context window

## Workflow

The self-healing loop follows this workflow:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize Arc Memory with the repository path
   - Check if a knowledge graph exists and build it if needed
   - Set up the orchestration layer

2. **Iteration Loop**:
   - For each iteration (up to the specified maximum):
     - Run the Code Review Agent to analyze the file
     - Run the Blast Radius Analysis Agent to analyze potential impacts
     - Run the Code Generation Agent to generate improved code
     - Evaluate the quality of the improvement
     - Accept the improvement if it meets the threshold, or try again

3. **Finalization**:
   - Select the best improvement across all iterations
   - Save the improved code to the specified output file
   - Provide a summary of the improvements made

## Implementation Details

### Context Window Management

The system leverages GPT-4.1's 1M token context window to ensure comprehensive context sharing:

- **Selective Context**: Each agent selects the most relevant context from the knowledge graph
- **Context Summarization**: Long contexts are summarized to fit within token limits
- **Incremental Context**: The context is built incrementally, focusing on the most important information first

### Tool Definition and Access

The system defines appropriate tools for each agent:

- **Code Review Tools**: Functions for analyzing code quality and patterns
- **Blast Radius Tools**: Functions for analyzing potential impacts
- **Code Generation Tools**: Functions for generating improved code
- **Evaluation Tools**: Functions for evaluating the quality of improvements

### State Management

The system tracks the state of the multi-agent workflow:

- **Iteration Tracking**: Keeps track of the current iteration and results
- **Best Improvement**: Tracks the best improvement across all iterations
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors gracefully and continues with the next iteration

### Performance Optimization

The system includes several optimizations:

- **Temporary Files**: Uses temporary files for inter-agent communication
- **Progress Tracking**: Provides progress updates during long-running operations
- **Caching**: Leverages Arc Memory's caching for repeated operations

## Integration with OpenAI Agents

The system can be integrated with OpenAI Assistants for a more interactive experience:

```python
from arc_memory.sdk import Arc
from arc_memory.sdk.adapters import get_adapter

# Initialize Arc with the repository path
arc = Arc(repo_path="./")

# Get the OpenAI adapter
openai_adapter = get_adapter("openai")

# Create an OpenAI Assistant with Arc Memory tools
assistant = openai_adapter.create_assistant(
    name="Self-Healing Code Assistant",
    instructions="""
    You are a Self-Healing Code Assistant that helps improve code quality.
    You can analyze code, identify issues, predict impacts, and generate improved code.
    Use the Arc Memory knowledge graph to understand the codebase context and patterns.
    """,
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=openai_adapter.adapt_functions([
        arc.query,
        arc.get_decision_trail,
        arc.get_related_entities,
        arc.analyze_component_impact
    ])
)
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

The system includes robust error handling:

- **Agent Failures**: If an agent fails, the system logs the error and continues with the next iteration
- **Graph Building Failures**: If graph building fails, the system provides clear instructions for manual building
- **Evaluation Failures**: If evaluation fails, the system uses a default score and continues
- **File Access Failures**: If file access fails, the system provides clear error messages and exits gracefully

## Customization Options

The system can be customized in several ways:

- **Iteration Count**: Adjust the number of iterations to control how many improvement attempts are made
- **Improvement Threshold**: Adjust the threshold to control how strict the system is about accepting changes
- **Agent Parameters**: Modify each agent's behavior by adjusting their parameters
- **System Message**: Customize the system message for the orchestration agent
- **Model Selection**: Choose different models for different agents based on their requirements

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

- **Single File Focus**: The system currently focuses on improving a single file at a time
- **Limited Testing**: The system does not automatically test the improved code
- **Manual Intervention**: The system requires manual review of the improvements
- **Context Window Limits**: Very large files may not be fully processed

### Future Improvements

- **Multi-File Refactoring**: Support for improving multiple files at once
- **Automated Testing**: Integration with testing frameworks to validate improvements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learning from accepted and rejected improvements
- **Interactive Mode**: Real-time interaction with the system during improvement
- **Custom Agents**: Support for adding custom specialized agents to the system

## Conclusion

The self-healing code generation loop demonstrates how multiple specialized agents can work together to improve code quality. By leveraging Arc Memory's knowledge graph and OpenAI's agent orchestration capabilities, the system provides a powerful tool for automatically improving code while considering both quality and potential impacts.
