*Arc is the memory layer for engineering teams — it records **why** every change was made, predicts the blast-radius of new code before you merge, and feeds that context to agents so they can handle long-range refactors safely.*

## What The Arc SDK Does

1. **Record the why.**
   Arc's Temporal Knowledge Graph ingests commits, PRs, issues, and ADRs to preserve architectural intent and decision history—entirely on your machine.

2. **Model the system.**
   From that history Arc derives a **causal graph** of services, data flows, and constraints—a lightweight world-model that stays in sync with the codebase.

3. **Capture causal relationships.**
   Arc tracks decision → implication → code-change chains, enabling multi-hop reasoning to show why decisions were made and their predicted impact.

4. **Enhance PR reviews.**
   Arc's GitHub Actions integration surfaces decision trails and blast-radius hints directly in PR comments, giving reviewers instant context before they hit "Approve."

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Arc Memory
pip install arc-memory[github]

# Build a knowledge graph from your repository
cd /path/to/your/repo
arc build --github

## Core Features

### Knowledge Graph

```bash
# Build with GitHub and Linear data
arc build --github --linear
```

### Decision Trails

```bash
# Show decision trail for a specific file and line
arc why file path/to/file.py 42

# Ask natural language questions
arc why query "What decision led to using SQLite instead of PostgreSQL?"
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

```bash
# Export knowledge graph for GitHub Actions
arc export <commit-sha> export.json --compress
```

## SDK for Developers

```python
from arc_memory import Arc

# Initialize Arc with your repository path
arc = Arc(repo_path="./")

# Ask a question about your codebase
result = arc.query("What were the major changes in the last release?")
print(f"Answer: {result.answer}")

# Find out why a specific piece of code exists
decision_trail = arc.get_decision_trail("src/auth/login.py", 42)
```

## Documentation

- [Getting Started Guide](./docs/getting_started.md) - Complete setup instructions
- [SDK Documentation](./docs/sdk/README.md) - Using the Arc Memory SDK
- [CLI Reference](./docs/cli/README.md) - Command-line interface details
- [Examples](./docs/examples/README.md) - Real-world usage examples

## Why It Matters

- **Faster onboarding** for new team members
- **Reduced knowledge loss** when developers leave
- **More efficient code reviews** with contextual insights
- **Safer refactoring** with impact prediction
- **Better agent coordination** through shared memory

## SDK for Developers and Agents

Arc Memory provides a clean, Pythonic SDK that enables both developers and AI agents to programmatically access the knowledge graph:

```python
from arc_memory import Arc

# Initialize Arc with your repository path
arc = Arc(repo_path="./")

# Ask a question about your codebase
result = arc.query("What were the major changes in the last release?")
print(f"Answer: {result.answer}")

# Find out why a specific piece of code exists
decision_trail = arc.get_decision_trail("src/core/auth.py", 42)
for entry in decision_trail:
    print(f"Decision: {entry.title}")
    print(f"Rationale: {entry.rationale}")

# Analyze the potential impact of a change
impact = arc.analyze_component_impact("file:src/api/endpoints.py")
for component in impact:
    print(f"Affected: {component.title} (Impact score: {component.impact_score})")
```

The SDK follows a framework-agnostic design with adapters for popular frameworks like LangChain and OpenAI, making it easy to integrate Arc Memory into your development workflows or AI applications.
