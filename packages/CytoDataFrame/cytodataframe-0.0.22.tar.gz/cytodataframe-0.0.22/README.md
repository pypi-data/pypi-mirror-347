_CytoDataFrame extends Pandas functionality to help display single-cell profile data alongside related images._

CytoDataFrame is an advanced in-memory data analysis format designed for single-cell profiling, integrating not only the data profiles but also their corresponding microscopy images and segmentation masks.
Traditional single-cell profiling often excludes the associated images from analysis, limiting the scope of research.
CytoDataFrame bridges this gap, offering a purpose-built solution for comprehensive analysis that incorporates both the data and images, empowering more detailed and visual insights in single-cell research.

CytoDataFrame development began within [coSMicQC](https://github.com/WayScience/coSMicQC) - a single-cell profile quality control package.

## Installation

Install CytoDataFrame from source using the following:

```shell
# install from pypi
pip install cytodataframe

# or install directly from source
