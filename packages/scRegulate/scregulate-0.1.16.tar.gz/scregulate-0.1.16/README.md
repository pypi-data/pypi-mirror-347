## Introduction
**scRegulate** is a powerful tool designed for the inference of transcription factor activity from single cell/nucleus RNA data using advanced generative modeling techniques. It leverages a unified learning framework to optimize the modeling of cellular regulatory networks, providing researchers with accurate insights into transcriptional regulation. With its efficient clustering capabilities, **scRegulate** facilitates the analysis of complex biological data, making it an essential resource for studies in genomics and molecular biology.

## Requirements
scRegulate is implemented in the PyTorch framework. Running scRegulate on `CUDA` is highly recommended if available.

Before installing and running scRegulate, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- **PyTorch** (version 2.0 or higher)
- **NumPy** (version 1.23 or higher)
- **Scanpy** (version 1.9 or higher)
- **Anndata** (version 0.8 or higher)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch numpy scanpy anndata
```

## Installation

You can install **scRegulate** via pip for a lightweight installation:

```bash
pip install scRegulate
```

Alternatively, if you want the latest, unreleased version, you can install it directly from the source on GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/YDaiLab/scRegulate.git
```

For users who prefer Conda or Mamba for environment management, you can install **scRegulate** along with extra dependencies using:

```bash
mamba create -n=scRegulate conda-forge::scRegulate
```
