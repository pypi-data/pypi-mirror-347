    -----
    - `allowed_methods`, `allowed_headers`, and `exposed_headers` should always be lists of strings.
    - `allowed_origins` can either be a single string or a list of strings.
    - `max_age` should be an integer representing the duration in seconds.
    - The `custom` attribute is for additional configurations or custom properties.
