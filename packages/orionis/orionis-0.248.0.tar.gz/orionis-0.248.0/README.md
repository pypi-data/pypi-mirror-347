## What is Orionis?

Orionis Framework was born from a bold vision: to propel a team of exceptionally talented developers into a new technological era without sacrificing their impact. This team, originally experts in PHP, thrived in an environment that enabled them to craft solutions with speed and precision. But as we looked ahead, we saw the need for something moreâ€”something capable of tackling cutting-edge challenges like RPA, AI, Blockchain, Data Analytics, OCR, and Computer Vision. The answer? **Python.**

Yet, transitioning to Python wasnâ€™t just about switching languagesâ€”it was about embracing an entirely new mindset. Unlike their familiar PHP framework, Pythonâ€™s structure and lifecycle presented challenges: How do we naturally organize classes? How do we manage a requestâ€™s lifecycle? And what about Middlewareâ€”so crucial in building robust applications? These were critical questions that demanded answers.

Then came the breakthrough: **What if we built something in Python that felt like home?**

Thatâ€™s how **Orionis Framework** was born. We designed it around the methodology this team already mastered, capturing their workflow and translating it into the Python ecosystem. We built initial features tailored to their strengths, allowing them to test-drive Orionis. The result? **A seamless transition.** Not only did they adapt quickly, but they also began to understand the inner workings of each componentâ€”transforming from mere users into true architects of their own solutions.

Orionis Framework is more than just a framework. Itâ€™s a movement, a community, and a force that transforms a simple technological shift into a true **evolution of skill.** By blending web craftsmanship with scientific precision, Orionis elevates development into a new frontier within the power of Python.
