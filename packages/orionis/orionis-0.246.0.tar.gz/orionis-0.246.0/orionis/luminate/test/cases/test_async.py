    """
    AsyncTestCase is a test case class designed for asynchronous unit testing.
    It inherits from `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` to provide support for
    async test methods and `TestStdOut` for additional functionality.
    Methods
    -------
    asyncSetUp()
        Asynchronous setup method called before each test. It ensures that the
        parent class's asyncSetUp method is invoked to initialize any required
        resources.
    asyncTearDown()
        Asynchronous teardown method called after each test. It ensures that the
        parent class's asyncTearDown method is invoked to clean up any resources
        used during the test.
