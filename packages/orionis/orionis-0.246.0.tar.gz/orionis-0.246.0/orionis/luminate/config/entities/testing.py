            - 2: Detailed output (default)
        execution_mode (ExecutionMode): The mode of test execution. Default is ExecutionMode.SEQUENTIAL.
            - ExecutionMode.SEQUENTIAL: Tests are executed one after another.
            - ExecutionMode.PARALLEL: Tests are executed in parallel.
        max_workers (int): The maximum number of worker threads/processes to use when running tests in parallel. Default is 4.
