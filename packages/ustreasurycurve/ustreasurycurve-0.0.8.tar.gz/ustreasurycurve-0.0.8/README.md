# USTreasuryCurve
This code pulls in all available nominal and real yield curves from the US Treasury's website into a Pandas dataframe. You can specify a start and/or end date if you want. The nominal rates start on January 2, 1990 and the real rates begin on January 2, 2003. The US Treasury updates these yields daily.
