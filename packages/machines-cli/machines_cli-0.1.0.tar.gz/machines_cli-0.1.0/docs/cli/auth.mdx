# Auth Commands

The `auth` command group allows you to manage your API keys for the LazyCloud CLI. Here are all the available commands:

## Add an API Key

Add a new API key with a specified name and value.

```bash
lazycloud auth add <name> <value>
```

### Example

```bash
lazycloud auth add my-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

The command will:
- Validate that the API key is valid before adding it
- If a key with the same name exists, prompt for confirmation to overwrite
- If this is the first key added, automatically set it as active

## List API Keys

List all available API keys and their status.

```bash
lazycloud auth ls
```

The output will show:
- Name of the key
- Value of the key
- Status (Active/Inactive)

## Get API Key

Get the value of a specific API key or the currently active key.

```bash
lazycloud auth get [name]
```

If no name is provided, it will show the active API key.

### Example

```bash
# Get active key
lazycloud auth get

# Get specific key
lazycloud auth get my-key
```

## Set Active API Key

Set which API key should be used for other commands.

```bash
lazycloud auth set <name>
```

### Example

```bash
lazycloud auth set my-key
```

## Remove API Key

Remove an API key by name.

```bash
lazycloud auth rm <name> [options]
```

### Options

- `--force` or `-f` - Force removal without confirmation

### Example

```bash
# Remove with confirmation
lazycloud auth rm my-key

# Force remove without confirmation
lazycloud auth rm my-key --force
```

## Examples

Here's a complete workflow example:

```bash
# Add a new API key
lazycloud auth add my-key YOUR_API_KEY

# List all keys
lazycloud auth ls

# Set this key as active
lazycloud auth set my-key

# Verify the active key
lazycloud auth get

# When done, remove the key
lazycloud auth rm my-key
```

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive names for your API keys
2. Keep your API keys secure and never share them
3. Use different keys for different environments (development, staging, production)
4. Regularly rotate your API keys for security
5. Remove unused API keys to keep your configuration clean
6. The active API key is used by default for all other commands
7. API key names are case-insensitive for consistency
8. Always validate your API keys before using them in production
