# Semantic versioning is a versioning scheme that uses the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
# Example: "0.0.1"
# - MAJOR: Incremented when you make incompatible API changes.
# - MINOR: Incremented when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
# - PATCH: Incremented when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

# In this case:
# - MAJOR = 0: Indicates that this is an early-stage version and the API may change.
# - MINOR = 0: No significant new features have been added yet.
# - PATCH = 1: This is the first patch release, addressing minor fixes or updates.

__version__ = "0.0.1"
