Write a solution plan for the machine learning problem outlined below. The solution must produce
a model that achieves the best possible performance on {{metric_to_optimise}}.

{% if deep_learning_available %}
If appropriate, consider using pre-trained models under 20MB that can be fine-tuned with the provided data.
{% endif %}

# TASK:
{{problem_statement}}

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU
The solution concept should be explained in 3-5 sentences. Do not include an implementation of the
solution, though you can include small code snippets if relevant to explain the plan.
Do not suggest doing EDA, ensembling, or hyperparameter tuning.
The solution should be feasible using only {{allowed_packages}}, and no other non-standard libraries.
