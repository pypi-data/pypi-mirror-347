#### The idea is...
# In case of severe error (uncontrolled crash), then start a new process.
# Hopefully previous process will be cleaned up by the OS.
# Probably only useful if taking audio stream from some external source, like S/PDIF
# The idea is also to never really need this

#### This file can be triggered at boot by:
# sudo nano /etc/rc.local 
# Then add one of these to the end of that file ('nice -n -10' is optional and usually does not matter):
# screen -d -m nice -n -10 /usr/local/bin/runNimRumForever /usr/local/bin/runNimRumTx
# screen -d -m nice -n -10 /usr/local/bin/runNimRumForever /usr/local/bin/runNimRumRx

# Depending on your installation these can come in handy:
# which ...
# pip show nimRum 
#
# Also, please put the tx|rxConfig.yaml-files in a folder named /root/nimRum/
#
# If you want to take a look at what is started in the background with screen, use:
# Connect to screen started by root:    sudo screen -r
# Leave screen:                         Ctrl-a + Ctrl-d
# Scroll inside screen:                 Ctrl-a + Esc
