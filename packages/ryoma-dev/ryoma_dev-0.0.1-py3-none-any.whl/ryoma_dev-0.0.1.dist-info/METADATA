            distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a
            display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
            third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are
            for informational purposes only and do not modify the License.
            You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
            distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
            provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.
        
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
            provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
            reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
            Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
            distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions
            stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions.
        
            Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
            submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under
            the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional
            terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall

            either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
            or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
            FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks

            warranty or additional liability.
        
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work
        
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate
            notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own
            identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be
            enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also
            recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included
            on the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

## Tech Stack

Our platform leverages a combination of cutting-edge technologies and frameworks:

- **[Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/)**: Facilitates the seamless integration of language models into application workflows, significantly enhancing AI interaction capabilities.
- **[Reflex](https://reflex.dev/)**: An open-source framework for quickly building beautiful, interactive web applications in pure Python
- **[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)**: A cross-language development platform for in-memory data that specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware like CPUs and GPUs.
- **[Jupyter Ai Magics](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai)**: A JupyterLab extension that provides a set of magics for working with AI models.
- **[Amundsen](https://www.amundsen.io/)**: A data discovery and metadata platform that helps users discover, understand, and trust the data they use.
- **[Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/)**: A Python data analysis framework that provides a pandas-like API for analytics on large datasets.
- **[Feast](https://feast.dev/)**: An operational feature store for managing and serving machine learning features to models in production.

## Installation
Simply install the package using pip:

```shell
pip install ryoma_ai
```
Or with extra dependencies:

```shell
pip install ryoma_ai[snowflake]
```

## Basic Example
Below is an example of using SqlAgent to connect to a postgres database and ask a question.
You can read more details in the [documentation](https://project-ryoma.github.io/ryoma/).

```python
from ryoma_ai.agent.sql import SqlAgent
from ryoma_ai.datasource.postgres import PostgresDataSource

# Connect to a postgres catalog
datasource = PostgresDataSource("postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname")

# Create a SQL agent
sql_agent = SqlAgent("gpt-3.5-turbo").add_datasource(datasource)

# ask question to the agent
sql_agent.stream("I want to get the top 5 customers which making the most purchases", display=True)
```

The Sql agent will try to run the tool as shown below:
```text
================================ Human Message =================================

I want to get the top 5 customers which making the most purchases
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  sql_database_query (call_mWCPB3GQGOTLYsvp21DGlpOb)
 Call ID: call_mWCPB3GQGOTLYsvp21DGlpOb
  Args:
    query: SELECT C.C_NAME, SUM(L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS TOTAL_PURCHASES FROM CUSTOMER C JOIN ORDERS O ON C.C_CUSTKEY = O.O_CUSTKEY JOIN LINEITEM L ON O.O_ORDERKEY = L.L_ORDERKEY GROUP BY C.C_NAME ORDER BY TOTAL_PURCHASES DESC LIMIT 5
    result_format: pandas
```
Continue to run the tool with the following code:
```python
sql_agent.stream(tool_mode=ToolMode.ONCE)
```
Output will look like after running the tool:
```text
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The top 5 customers who have made the most purchases are as follows:

1. Customer#000143500 - Total Purchases: $7,154,828.98
2. Customer#000095257 - Total Purchases: $6,645,071.02
3. Customer#000087115 - Total Purchases: $6,528,332.52
4. Customer#000134380 - Total Purchases: $6,405,556.97
5. Customer#000103834 - Total Purchases: $6,397,480.12
```

## Use Ryoma Lab
Ryoma lab is an application that allows you to interact with your data and AI models in UI.
The ryoma lab is built with [Reflex](https://reflex.dev/).

1. Create Ryoma lab configuration file `rxconfig.py` in your project:
```python
import logging

import reflex as rx
from reflex.constants import LogLevel

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="ryoma_lab",
    loglevel=LogLevel.INFO,
)

# Setup basic configuration for logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
```

2. You can start the ryoma lab by running the following command:
```shell
ryoma_lab run
```
the ryoma lab will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
