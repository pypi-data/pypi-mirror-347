# or-lib

**or-lib** is a modular extension of [LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) that enriches the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by integrating **graph-based algorithms** for efficient and quality-enhanced retrieval and **image-based query support** for multimodal reasoning. It builds upon LightRAG‚Äôs hybrid architecture to improve both **retrieval accuracy** and **user interactivity**.

## üîç Key Enhancements Over LightRAG

### 1. Graph-Based Retrieval Optimization

Introduces several graph algorithms to rank and filter knowledge graph nodes and relationships for more relevant information retrieval:

* **Degree Centrality**
* **PageRank**
* **Article Rank** (personalized PageRank)
* **Betweenness Centrality**
* **CELF-Based Influence Maximization**

> These algorithms help dynamically identify high-impact entities and relations in the knowledge graph, improving time by 50%  and retrieval quality by 30%.

### 2. Image Query Support

Enhances RAG to handle image-based prompts via pre-indexed image metadata and summaries:

* Extracts and processes image chunks in `_build_query_context()`
* Associates each image with a unique S3 `image_id`
* Returns presigned image URLs for downstream consumption
* Adds visual context understanding into RAG flows

| Feature                      | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GraphAlgorithms`            | Modular class with pluggable centrality/influence metrics. Used at query time to score entities.              |
| `QueryParam.graph_algorithm` | Users can dynamically select which graph algorithm to apply per query (`pagerank`, `degree_centrality`, etc). |
| `Image Chunk Processing`     | Enhances query results with structured image summaries and image IDs that can be mapped to S3-hosted images.  |
| `Presigned URL Integration`  | Supports image result delivery through S3-backed URL mapping.                                                 |

## üß† Graph Algorithm

The `GraphAlgorithms` class (in `algorithms.py`) provides the following methods:

```python
compute_degree_centrality(node_datas, edge_datas, k, weighted=False)
compute_pagerank(node_datas, edge_datas, k)
compute_article_rank(node_datas, edge_datas, k)
compute_betweenness_centrality(node_datas, edge_datas, k)
celf_influence_maximization(node_datas, edge_datas, k)
```

Each method updates `node_datas` with rank scores and returns the top `k` nodes.

---

## üßæ Usage Example

```python
from orlib.algorithms import GraphAlgorithms
graph_algo = GraphAlgorithms()

top_nodes = graph_algo.compute_pagerank(node_datas, edge_datas, k=10)
```

To use it in a query:

```python
query_param.graph_algorithm = "pagerank"
response, image_ids = await kg_query(
    query,
    knowledge_graph_inst,
    entities_vdb,
    relationships_vdb,
    text_chunks_db,
    query_param,
    global_config
)
```

## üñºÔ∏è Image Support

### ‚ú® What It Does:

* Parses uploaded documents and stores image summaries as chunks, along with relevant metadata such as `image_id` (used for S3 mapping).
* During image-related queries, retrieves the relevant image chunks.
* Extracts summaries and metadata for matching image chunks.
* Sends the image summaries in CSV format to the LLM.
* Filters out image IDs whose summaries are most relevant to the query.
* Implements caching of image IDs related to previous queries to avoid redundant processing.
* Returns the relevant image IDs.
* Generates presigned URLs for image access.

### üîÅ Flow:

1. Image metadata is indexed with `image_id` and `content`.

2. During a query:

   * Keywords are matched against stored image chunks.
   * Relevant results are structured into an `image_chunk`.

3. An `img_prompt` is generated using:

   ```python
   image_csv_data = "serial number,image id,image summary\n1,img001,..."
   ```

4. The LLM receives both textual and visual context for improved relevance.

### üóÇÔ∏è Image Storage

Images are expected to be pre-processed and stored in **S3**. The corresponding `image_id` is then used to generate **presigned URLs** for secure frontend rendering.

## üß™ QueryParam Extensions

```python
QueryParam(
    graph_algorithm="pagerank",
    only_need_prompt=False,
    top_k=60,
    response_type="Bullet Points",
    ...
)
```

* `graph_algorithm`: Selects the algorithm to guide ranking logic in the retrieval phase.
* `top_k`: Defines how many top nodes or relationships to consider.
* `only_need_context` / `only_need_prompt`: Controls which intermediate step to return (useful for debugging or chaining outputs).
