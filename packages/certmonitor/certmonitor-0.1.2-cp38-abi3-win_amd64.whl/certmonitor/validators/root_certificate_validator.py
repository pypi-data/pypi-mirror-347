class RootCertificateValidator(BaseCertValidator):
    """
    A validator for checking if the SSL certificate is issued by a trusted root CA.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the validator.

        Validates if the SSL certificate is issued by a trusted root CA.

        Args:
            cert (dict): The SSL certificate.
            host (str): The hostname (not used in this validator).
            port (int): The port number (not used in this validator).

                This example shows a certificate that is signed by a trusted root CA, so validation passes and no warnings are present.
