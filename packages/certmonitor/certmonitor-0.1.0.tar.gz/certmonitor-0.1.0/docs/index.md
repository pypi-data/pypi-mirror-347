**CertMonitor** is a modern, robust, and extensible Python library for programmatically retrieving, validating, and monitoring SSL/TLS certificates and connection security for any host or service.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Easy Certificate Retrieval**: Fetch and parse certificates from any host (domain or IP) with a single call.
- **Pluggable Validators**: Built-in and custom validators for expiration, hostname, SANs, key strength, cipher, protocol version, and more.
- **Rich API**: Access raw certificate data, cipher info, and validation results in structured Python objects or JSON.
- **Rust-Powered Performance**: Advanced public key parsing and elliptic curve support are powered by Rust for speed and safety. All orchestration and logic are pure Python standard library.
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Robust to network failures, invalid hosts, and edge cases.
- **Modern Python**: Async-ready, type-annotated, and compatible with Python 3.8+.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Usage guides, API reference, and real-world examples.

## üì¶ Quickstart

```bash
pip install certmonitor
```

```python
from certmonitor import CertMonitor

with CertMonitor("example.com") as monitor:
    cert_info = monitor.get_cert_info()
    print(cert_info)
    pem = monitor.get_raw_pem()
    print(pem)
    der = monitor.get_raw_der()
    print(der)
    results = monitor.validate({"subject_alt_names": ["example.com", "www.example.com"]})
    print(results["expiration"])
    print(results["subject_alt_names"])
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Output

### Certificate Info

This is a sample of the structured certificate info returned by `monitor.get_cert_info()`:

```json
{
  "subject": {
    "commonName": "example.com"
  },
  "issuer": {
    "organizationName": "DigiCert Inc",
    "commonName": "DigiCert TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1"
  },
  "notBefore": "2024-06-01T00:00:00",
  "notAfter": "2025-09-01T23:59:59",
  "serialNumber": "0A1B2C3D4E5F6789",
  "subjectAltName": {
    "DNS": ["example.com", "www.example.com"],
    "IP Address": []
  },
  "publicKeyInfo": {
    "algorithm": "rsaEncryption",
    "size": 2048,
    "curve": null
  }
}
```

### PEM Format

This is a sample of the PEM format returned by `monitor.get_raw_pem()`:

```pem
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIID...snip...IDAQAB
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### DER Format

This is a sample of the DER format returned by `monitor.get_raw_der()` (as bytes, shown here as base64):

```text
MIID...snip...IDAQAB
```

### Validation Results

```json
{
  "expiration": {
    "is_valid": true,
    "days_to_expiry": 120,
    "expires_on": "2025-09-01T23:59:59",
    "warnings": []
  },
  "subject_alt_names": {
    "is_valid": true,
    "sans": {"DNS": ["example.com", "www.example.com"], "IP Address": []},
    "count": 2,
    "contains_host": {"name": "example.com", "is_valid": true, "reason": "Matched DNS SAN"},
    "contains_alternate": {"www.example.com": {"name": "www.example.com", "is_valid": true, "reason": "Matched DNS SAN"}},
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

## üìö Documentation

CertMonitor provides a robust, extensible system of **validators**‚Äîmodular checks that automatically assess certificate health, security, and compliance. Validators can:

- Detect expired or soon-to-expire certificates
- Ensure hostnames and SANs match
- Enforce strong key types and lengths
- Require modern TLS versions and strong cipher suites
- Allow you to add custom organization-specific checks

This makes CertMonitor ideal for continuous monitoring, compliance automation, and proactive security.

- [Validators](validators/index.md): Built-in and custom validators, with example outputs.
- [API Reference](reference/certmonitor.md): Full Python API docs, including all classes and methods.
- [Development Guide](development.md): Contributing, building, and testing CertMonitor.
