# vAPI Runtime
 
vAPI Runtime is a client library which facilitates invocations of the vSphere Automation APIs from a Python application. It contains HTTP client, API messages serializers, and API input/output validators and converters to native Python types.
 
This library is required by other SDK modules that contain Python language binding for specific APIs and is installed automatically with them.
