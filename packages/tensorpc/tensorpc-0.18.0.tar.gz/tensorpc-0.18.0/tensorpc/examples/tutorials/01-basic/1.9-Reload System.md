## Reload System

When you start a App from standard node, the App will be reloaded when you change the code. This is very useful for development.

The reload process will happen iff:

* layout function changed

* event handler changed (must be a standard function, dynamic functions defined inside function body or lambdas will not be reloaded)

* autorun function changed

The reload process will NOT happen:

* code except layout function, callbacks and autorun changed

* new callback function / layout function added after app launch changed

You should have already seen these features in previous tutorials. Modify layout function / callbacks / autorun function, and interact with the app to see the changes.
