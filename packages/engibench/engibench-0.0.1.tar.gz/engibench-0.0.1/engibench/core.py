class Problem(Generic[DesignType]):
    r"""Main class for defining an engineering design problem.

    This class assumes there is:

    - an underlying simulator that is called to evaluate the performance of a design (see `simulate` method);
    - a dataset containing representations of designs and their performances (see `design_space`, `dataset_id` attributes);

    The main API methods that users should use are:

    - :meth:`check_constraints` - to check if a design and conditions violate any constraints.
    - :meth:`simulate` - to simulate a design and return the performance given some conditions.
    - :meth:`optimize` - to optimize a design starting from a given point, e.g., using adjoint solver included inside the simulator.
    - :meth:`reset` - to reset the simulator and numpy random to a given seed.
    - :meth:`render` - to render a design in a human-readable format.
    - :meth:`random_design` - to generate a valid random design.

    There are some attributes that help understanding the problem:

    - :attr:`objectives` - a dictionary with the names of the objectives and their types (minimize or maximize).
    - :attr:`conditions` - the conditions for the design problem.
    - :attr:`design_space` - the space of designs (outputs of algorithms).
    - :attr:`dataset_id` - a string identifier for the problem -- useful to pull datasets.
    - :attr:`dataset` - the dataset with designs and performances.
    - :attr:`container_id` - a string identifier for the singularity container.

    Having all these defined in the code allows to easily extract the columns we want from the dataset to train ML models.

    Note:
        This class is generic and should be subclassed to define the specific problem.

    Note:
        This class is parameterized with `DesignType` is the type of the design that is optimized (e.g. a Numpy array representing the design).

    Note:
        Some simulators also ask for simulator related configurations. These configurations are generally defined in the
        problem implementation, do not appear in the `problem.conditions`, but sometimes appear in the dataset (for
        advanced usage). You can override them by using the `config` argument in the `simulate` or `optimize` method.
