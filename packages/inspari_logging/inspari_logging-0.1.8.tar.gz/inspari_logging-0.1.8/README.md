This repository provides Python logging utilities.

### Configuration

The `inspari.logging` module provides unified interface for loading logging configuration files in app code and from 
gunicorn. In addition, a range of utilities (service name prefixing, command line colors etc.) are provided. 

An example logging configuration file is bundled (`example_logging_config.json`), along with an example of the usage in 
an application context (`example_usage.py`).

### Stream logs

The streamlogs command line utility provides a simple way to stream logs in _realtime_. To enable log collection, add a 
handler as part of your logging configuration,

```json
    "handlers": {
        "web": {
            "class": "inspari.logging.AzureBlobStorageHandler",
            "formatter": "simple",
            "load_dot_env": "true",
            "env_key": "ABS_CONNECTION_STRING",
            "log_local": "true"
        },
        ...
    },
    ...
    "root": {
        "level": "INFO",
        "handlers": [
            "web",
            ...
        ]
    },
```

and configure the logs as demonstrated in `example_usage.py`. The storage account to use for streaming must be specified
via environment variables. In the example case, a connection string is used. Hence, for local development purposes, 
it is recommended to create a .env file with the content like,

```bash
ABS_CONNECTION_STRING=REDACTED
```

Note that by default, logs are written to container called `logs`, so you must create a container with this name,
if it doesn't already exist. If you now run,

```bash
poetry run steamlogs
```

you should be getting logs in (near) realtime from all services connected to the account.

### Development

Create a new Python environment with all dependencies installed,

```bash
poetry sync
```

That's it! You can validate that the environment is setup correctly by running the tests,

```bash
poetry run coverage run -m pytest
```

### Deployment

Update the version in `pyproject.toml`, run `poetry lock`, and add a new entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.

#### Automatic (preferred)

Merge the changes into master (using PRs). Create a new tag. If the new version is `1.1.1`, the new tag would be `v1.1.1`. 

The tag creation will trigger automated deployment of the package to PyPi, as well as synchronization of the code with the public GitHub mirror repository.

#### Manual (not recommended)

Build the project via Poetry,

```bash
poetry build
```

and push it to pypi,

```bash
poetry publish -u __token__ -p $INSPARI_PYPI_TOKEN
```
