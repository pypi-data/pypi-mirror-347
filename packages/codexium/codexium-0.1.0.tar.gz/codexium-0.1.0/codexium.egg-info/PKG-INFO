MIT License

This software is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE), which allows you to use it for free for any lawful purpose, without restriction. 

Note: The Cohere AI API key is required for the tool to work. You can either pass it directly via the --api-key flag or set the COHERE_API_KEY environment variable. If you do not have a Cohere AI API key, you can sign up for a free trial or apply for a pro account. 

I hope this automatically generated README file provides a good starting point for your project and helps you understand the functionality and requirements of Codexium.
