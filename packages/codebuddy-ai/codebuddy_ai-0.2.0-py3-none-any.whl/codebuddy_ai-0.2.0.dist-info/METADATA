# Commit-Gen CLI Tool

Commit-Gen is a powerful Python CLI tool designed to streamline your commit workflow. It automatically extracts the staged Git diff, sends it to a commit-generation server, and prints a clear, concise commit message based on the changes made. This process helps ensure that your commit history remains informative and consistent.

## Features

- **Automated Commit Messages:**  
  Generates detailed commit messages based on staged code changes.
- **Easy Integration:**  
  Works directly with your Git workflow.

## Installation

Install Commit-Gen directly from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install commit-generator
```

# Usage

# Basic Workflow

- **Stage Your Changes:**

Begin by staging your changes in Git using:

```
git add .
```

- **Generate the Commit Message:**

Execute the Commit-Gen tool to generate your commit message:

```
commit-gen
```

The CLI tool will:

- Extract the staged Git diff.
- Communicate with the commit-generation server.
- Output a generated commit message that summarizes your changes.

* **Apply the Commit Message:**

Use the generated message when committing your changes:

```
git commit -m "$(commit-gen)"
```
