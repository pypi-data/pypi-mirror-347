# Cisco NSO MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for [Cisco NSO (Network Services Orchestrator)](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/networking/software/crosswork-network-services-orchestrator/index.html) that enables AI-powered network automation through natural language interactions.

## Overview

This package provides a standalone MCP server for Cisco NSO, written in Python, that exposes capabilities in Cisco NSO as MCP tools and resources that can be consumed by an [MCP-compatible client](#connecting-to-the-server-with-mcp-client).

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that standardizes how AI models interact with external tools and services. MCP enables:

- **Tool Definition**: Structured way to define tools that AI models can use
- **Tool Discovery**: Mechanism for models to discover available tools
- **Tool Execution**: Standardized method for models to call tools and receive results
- **Context Management**: Efficient passing of context between tools and models
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works across multiple AI frameworks including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and others
- **Interoperability**: Provides a common language for AI systems to communicate with external tools

## Features

- **Stdio Transport**: By default, this MCP server uses stdio transport for process-bound communication
- **Tool-First Design**: Network operations are defined as discrete tools with clear interfaces
- **Asynchronous Processing**: All network operations are implemented asynchronously for better performance
- **Structured Responses**: Consistent response format with status, data, and metadata sections
- **Environment Resources**: Provides contextual information about the NSO environment

Environment variables take precedence over default values but are overridden by command-line arguments.

## Usage

### Connecting to the Server with MCP Client

You can connect to the server using any MCP client that supports the selected transport type.

### Using with Windsurf Cascade

Windsurf Cascade [supports MCP servers](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp#model-context-protocol-mcp) through a configuration file. To use the Cisco NSO MCP server with Windsurf, add it to your `mcp_config.json` file.

#### Using uv (recommended)

When using uv, no specific installation is needed. You can use `uvx` to directly run the package:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nso": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "cisco-nso-mcp-server",
        "--nso-address=127.0.0.1",
        "--nso-port=8080",
        "--nso-username=admin",
        "--nso-password=admin"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LOG_FILE": "/path/to/your/logs/nso-mcp.log"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `env` section is optional. If you include it, you can specify the `LOG_FILE` environment variable to enable file logging.

#### Using with pip installation

Alternatively, you can install `cisco-nso-mcp-server` via pip:

```bash
pip install cisco-nso-mcp-server
```

Now you can use the direct path to the executable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nso": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/env/bin/cisco-nso-mcp-server",
      "args": [
        "--nso-address=127.0.0.1",
        "--nso-port=8080",
        "--nso-username=admin",
        "--nso-password=admin"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LOG_FILE": "/path/to/your/logs/nso-mcp.log"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/env/bin/cisco-nso-mcp-server` with the actual path where you [installed the package with pip](#using-with-pip-installation). You can find this by running `which cisco-nso-mcp-server` if you installed it in your main environment, or by locating it in your virtual environment's bin directory.

The `env` section is optional. If you include it, you can specify the `LOG_FILE` environment variable to enable file logging.

At this point you can restart Windsurf and you should see it appear in the list of MCP servers with the list of available tools

### Using in a custom MCP client Python application with stdio transport

For stdio transport in a Python application, you'll need to spawn the server process and communicate through stdin/stdout:

```python
import os
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from contextlib import AsyncExitStack

async def connect():
    exit_stack = AsyncExitStack()
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command="cisco-nso-mcp-server",
        args=[
            "--nso-address=127.0.0.1",
            "--nso-port=8080",
            "--nso-username=admin",
            "--nso-password=admin"
        ],
        # Pass current environment variables to ensure LOG_FILE and other env vars are available
        env={**os.environ}
    )
    
    stdio_transport = await exit_stack.enter_async_context(stdio_client(server_params))
    stdio, write = stdio_transport
    session = await exit_stack.enter_async_context(ClientSession(stdio, write))
    await session.initialize()
    
    # Now you can use the session to call tools and read resources
    return session
```

### Running the Server as Standalone

While the server is typically used with an MCP client as shown above, you can also run it directly as a standalone process:

```bash
# Run with default NSO connection and MCP settings (see Configuration Options above for details)
cisco-nso-mcp-server

# Run with custom NSO connection parameters
cisco-nso-mcp-server --nso-address 192.168.1.100 --nso-port 8888 --nso-username myuser --nso-password mypass
```

When running in standalone mode with stdio transport, you'll need to pipe input/output to the process or use it with an MCP client that supports stdio transport.

## Implementation Details

### Asynchronous Processing

The MCP server leverages Python's asynchronous programming capabilities to efficiently handle network operations:

- **Async Function Definitions**: All tool functions are defined with `async def` to make them coroutines
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Network calls to Cisco NSO are wrapped with `asyncio.to_thread()` to prevent blocking the event loop
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple tool calls can be processed simultaneously without waiting for previous operations to complete
- **Error Handling**: Asynchronous try/except blocks capture and properly format errors from network operations

### NSO Integration with cisco-nso-restconf

This MCP server uses the [cisco-nso-restconf](https://github.com/dbono711/cisco-nso-restconf) Python library to facilitate communication with Cisco NSO:

- **Simplified API**: The library provides a clean, Pythonic interface to NSO's RESTCONF API
- **Authentication**: Handles HTTP Basic authentication with NSO automatically
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages for NSO-specific errors
- **Data Conversion**: Converts between JSON and NSO's YANG data models
- **Session Management**: Maintains persistent connections to improve performance

The library abstracts away the complexities of direct RESTCONF API calls, allowing the MCP server to focus on implementing the MCP protocol and tool definitions rather than low-level HTTP and data format details.

### Logging System

The server uses a flexible logging system that can be configured through environment variables:

- **Default Behavior**: By default, logs are sent to stdout only
- **File Logging**: When the `LOG_FILE` environment variable is set, logs are sent to both stdout and the specified file
- **Error Handling**: If the log file cannot be created or written to, the server falls back to stdout-only logging with an error message
- **Log Format**: Logs include timestamp, level, and message in a consistent format
