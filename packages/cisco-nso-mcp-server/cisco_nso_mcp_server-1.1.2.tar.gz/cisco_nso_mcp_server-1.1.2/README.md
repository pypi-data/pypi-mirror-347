# Cisco NSO MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Cisco NSO (Network Services Orchestrator) that enables AI-powered network automation through natural language interactions.

## Overview

This package provides a standalone MCP server for Cisco NSO, written in Python, that can be installed with ```pip``` and run as a command-line tool. It exposes capabilities in Cisco NSO as MCP tools and resources that can be consumed by any MCP-compatible client.

```bash
# Install the package
pip install cisco-nso-mcp-server

# Run the server
cisco-nso-mcp-server
```

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that standardizes how AI models interact with external tools and services. MCP enables:

- **Tool Definition**: Structured way to define tools that AI models can use
- **Tool Discovery**: Mechanism for models to discover available tools
- **Tool Execution**: Standardized method for models to call tools and receive results
- **Context Management**: Efficient passing of context between tools and models
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works across multiple AI frameworks including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and others
- **Interoperability**: Provides a common language for AI systems to communicate with external tools

### Note on MCP Flexibility

Although the primary use case for MCP is integration with LLMs, MCP and similar tool frameworks (like Smithery) are LLM-agnostic - they're simply APIs with a specific protocol. This means you can:

- **Use them directly** in any application without an LLM
- **Let an LLM control them** through an integration layer
- **Mix both approaches** depending on your specific needs and use cases

This flexibility makes MCP tools valuable beyond just LLM applications, serving as standardized interfaces for various automation needs.

## Features

- **Stdio Transport**: By default, the server uses stdio transport for process-bound communication
- **Tool-First Design**: Network operations are defined as discrete tools with clear interfaces
- **Asynchronous Processing**: All network operations are implemented asynchronously for better performance
- **Structured Responses**: Consistent response format with status, data, and metadata sections
- **Environment Resources**: Provides contextual information about the NSO environment

```

### Configuration Options

You can configure the server using command-line arguments or environment variables:

#### NSO Connection Parameters

| Command-line Argument | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `--nso-scheme`       | `NSO_SCHEME`        | http    | NSO connection scheme (http/https) |
| `--nso-address`      | `NSO_ADDRESS`       | localhost | NSO server address |
| `--nso-port`         | `NSO_PORT`          | 8080    | NSO server port |
| `--nso-timeout`      | `NSO_TIMEOUT`       | 10      | Connection timeout in seconds |
| `--nso-username`     | `NSO_USERNAME`      | admin   | NSO username |
| `--nso-password`     | `NSO_PASSWORD`      | admin   | NSO password |

#### MCP Server Parameters

| Command-line Argument | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `--transport`        | `MCP_TRANSPORT`     | stdio   | MCP transport type (stdio/sse) |

#### SSE Transport Options (only used when --transport=sse) (IN DEVELOPMENT)

| Command-line Argument | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `--host`             | `MCP_HOST`          | 0.0.0.0 | Host to bind to when using SSE transport |
| `--port`             | `MCP_PORT`          | 8000    | Port to bind to when using SSE transport |

#### Logging Configuration

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `LOG_FILE`          | None    | Path to log file. If not set, logs will be sent to stdout only |

Environment variables take precedence over default values but are overridden by command-line arguments.

### Connecting to the Server with MCP Client

You can connect to the server using any MCP client that supports the selected transport type.

#### Using with Windsurf IDE Cascade

Windsurf IDE Cascade [supports MCP servers](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp#model-context-protocol-mcp) through a configuration file. To use the Cisco NSO MCP server with Windsurf, add it to your `mcp_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nso": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/env/bin/cisco-nso-mcp-server",
      "args": [
        "--nso-address=127.0.0.1",
        "--nso-port=8080",
        "--nso-username=admin",
        "--nso-password=admin"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LOG_FILE": "/path/to/your/logs/nso-mcp.log"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/env/bin/cisco-nso-mcp-server` with the actual path where you [installed the package with pip](#installation). You can find this by running `which cisco-nso-mcp-server` if you installed it in your main environment, or by locating it in your virtual environment's bin directory.

The `env` section is optional. If you include it, you can specify the `LOG_FILE` environment variable to enable file logging.

At this point you can restart Windsurf and you should see it appear in the list of MCP servers with the list of available tools

#### Using in a custom MCP client Python application with stdio transport

For stdio transport in a Python application, you'll need to spawn the server process and communicate through stdin/stdout:

```python
import os
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from contextlib import AsyncExitStack

async def connect():
    exit_stack = AsyncExitStack()
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command="cisco-nso-mcp-server",
        args=[
            "--nso-address=127.0.0.1",
            "--nso-port=8080",
            "--nso-username=admin",
            "--nso-password=admin"
        ],
        # Pass current environment variables to ensure LOG_FILE and other env vars are available
        env={**os.environ}
    )
    
    stdio_transport = await exit_stack.enter_async_context(stdio_client(server_params))
    stdio, write = stdio_transport
    session = await exit_stack.enter_async_context(ClientSession(stdio, write))
    await session.initialize()
    
    # Now you can use the session to call tools and read resources
    return session
```

## Implementation Details

### Asynchronous Processing

The MCP server leverages Python's asynchronous programming capabilities to efficiently handle network operations:

- **Async Function Definitions**: All tool functions are defined with `async def` to make them coroutines
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Network calls to Cisco NSO are wrapped with `asyncio.to_thread()` to prevent blocking the event loop
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple tool calls can be processed simultaneously without waiting for previous operations to complete
- **Error Handling**: Asynchronous try/except blocks capture and properly format errors from network operations

### Logging System

The server uses a flexible logging system that can be configured through environment variables:

- **Default Behavior**: By default, logs are sent to stdout only
- **File Logging**: When the `LOG_FILE` environment variable is set, logs are sent to both stdout and the specified file
- **Error Handling**: If the log file cannot be created or written to, the server falls back to stdout-only logging with an error message
- **Log Format**: Logs include timestamp, level, and message in a consistent format
- **Log Levels**: Supports standard Python logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

This approach ensures that the server can run in various environments without permission issues, while still providing flexible logging options.
