# cppFileGenerator

## Description
A Python project designed to aid explicitly instantiate templates of CPP/HPP Files.
This is mainly for my own use, but feel free to use it as well.
Its designed around prototyping by manually writing the C++ files, copy and pasting the code, and then using this package to generate permutations of the code.

## Features
- Generates permutations for every combination of provided template parameters.
- Generates permutations the same as above, but allows for special characters to signify that some templates are the same.

## Installation
pip install cppFileGenerator==###
