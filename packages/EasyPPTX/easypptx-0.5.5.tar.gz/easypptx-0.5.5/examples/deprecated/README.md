# Deprecated Examples

This directory contains examples that have been superseded by improved versions in other directories.

## Grid Examples

The grid-related examples in this directory have been reorganized and improved in the `examples/grid/` directory:

- **grid_layout_example.py** → `examples/grid/001_basic_grid.py`
- **grid_indexing_example.py** → `examples/grid/002_grid_indexing.py`
- **nested_grid_example.py** → `examples/grid/003_nested_grid.py`
- **autogrid_pyplot_example.py** and **grid_methods_example.py** → `examples/grid/004_autogrid.py`
- **grid_complete_example.py** → consolidated into the above examples

Please use the new examples in the `examples/grid/` directory instead.
