## üí° Usage

Here‚Äôs a quick example to get you started:

```python
from modelmyfinance import FinanceModel

# Create a financial model
model = FinanceModel(initial_investment=10000, growth_rate=0.05, time_horizon=10)

# Calculate future value
future_value = model.calculate_future_value()
print(f"Future Value: ${future_value:.2f}")

# Run a Monte Carlo simulation
simulation = model.run_monte_carlo_simulation(iterations=1000)
simulation.plot_results()
```
