## A lightweight Python utility toolkit

**pycuts** is a flexible Python utility toolkit that provides convenient, modular shortcuts for working with popular libraries such as [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio), and [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface). It simplifies common tasks, offers helpful runtime utilities, and is designed to evolve alongside the workflow.

> This is a personal collection of utilities and shortcuts I find useful when working with various Python libraries. While tailored to my own needs, others may very well find them helpful too.
