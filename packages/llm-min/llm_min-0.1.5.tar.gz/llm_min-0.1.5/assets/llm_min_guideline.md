**`llm_min_guideline`: STRUCTURE & PARSING GUIDE FOR `llm_min.txt`**

The `llm_min.txt` content is a compressed text format. Parse it as follows:

1.  **Header Line:**
    - Format: `#LIB:{LibraryName}#VER:{Version}#DATE:{Timestamp}`
    - This line identifies the library and content version.

2.  **Schema Definition Block (`#SCHEMA_DEF_BEGIN...#SCHEMA_DEF_END`):**
    - `AIU_FIELDS:id;typ;name;purp;in;out;use;rel;src`
        - Defines the abbreviations (e.g., `id`, `typ`) used as keys for the top-level fields in an Atomic Information Unit (AIU).
    - `IN_FIELDS:p;t;d;def;ex`
        - Defines abbreviations (e.g., `p` for parameter name, `t` for type) for keys within objects in an AIU's `in` list.
    - `OUT_FIELDS:f;t;d`
        - Defines abbreviations (e.g., `f` for field name) for keys within objects in an AIU's `out` list.
    - `REL_FIELDS:id;typ`
        - Defines abbreviations for keys within objects in an AIU's `rel` list.

3.  **AIU List Block (`#AIU_LIST_BEGIN...#AIU_LIST_END`):**
    - This block contains all Atomic Information Units (AIUs).

4.  **Individual AIU Format (`#AIU#...#END_AIU`):**
    - Each AIU is typically a single line of text.
    - **Top-Level Fields:** Fields are separated by a semicolon (`;`). Each field is an `abbreviation:value` pair (e.g., `id:some_id;typ:Feat;name:SomeName;...`). The abbreviations are defined in `AIU_FIELDS`.
        - `id`: (String) Unique identifier for the AIU.
        - `typ`: (String) Type of the AIU (see "KEY ABBREVIATIONS" below).
        - `name`: (String) Canonical name of the AIU.
        - `purp`: (String) Concise purpose description.
        - `in`: (String representing a List of Objects) Input parameters/configurations. Format: `[{p:val;t:val;...},{...}]`. Each object within the list contains `abbreviation:value` pairs separated by `;`; abbreviations are from `IN_FIELDS`.
        - `out`: (String representing a List of Objects) Outputs/return fields. Format: `[{f:val;t:val;...},{...}]`. Each object uses abbreviations from `OUT_FIELDS`.
        - `use`: (String) Minimal code/config pattern showing core usage.
        - `rel`: (String representing a List of Objects) Relationships to other AIUs. Format: `[{id:val;typ:val},{...}]`. Each object uses abbreviations from `REL_FIELDS`.
        - `src`: (String) Source reference (original chunk identifier).
    - **Parsing Lists of Objects (`in`, `out`, `rel`):**
        - These fields are strings that represent a list of objects.
        - The list starts with `[` and ends with `]`.
        - Objects within the list are enclosed in `{}` and separated by commas `,`.
        - Inside each object, `abbreviation:value` pairs are separated by semicolons `;`.
        - Example for `in`: `in:[{p:param1;t:str;d:Desc1},{p:param2;t:int;def:0;ex:10}]`
    - **Empty Lists/Values:** Represented as `[]` for lists. An optional field might be missing or its value might be empty after the colon (e.g., `def:;`).

**YOUR TASK: RESPONDING TO USER INTENT (using `llm_min_guideline`)**

When a user asks a question or states an intent related to the library identified in the `llm_min.txt` header:

1.  **Deconstruct Intent:** Understand the user's specific goal with the library.
2.  **Identify Primary AIUs:** Search the `llm_min.txt` content. Prioritize `Feat`, `HowTo`, `Patt`, and `Scen` AIUs whose `name` or `purp` (purpose) field closely matches the user's intent. These are your main entry points.
3.  **Consult `use` Field:** The `use` field of these primary AIUs contains practical code examples or usage patterns. This is your **primary source** for generating code responses.
4.  **Examine Inputs (`in` field):** If the primary AIU or its `use` example involves configuration or parameters:
    *   Carefully parse the `in` field of the primary AIU.
    *   Also check the `in` field of any related `CfgObj` AIUs (found via the `rel` field, typically with `typ:C` or `typ:A`).
    *   Use the `p` (parameter name), `t` (type), `d` (description), `def` (default), and `ex` (example) sub-fields from the objects within the `in` list to understand how to configure the operation.
    *   Adapt parameters based on the user's specific request details.
5.  **Follow Relationships (`rel` field) if Necessary:**
    *   If a `HowTo` or `Patt` AIU's `rel` field links to other `Feat` or `CfgObj` AIUs, consult these related AIUs for more details on their configuration or underlying capabilities if the primary AIU isn't sufficient.
6.  **Understand Outputs (`out` field):** The `out` field of an AIU (or a related `DataObj` AIU) describes what the operation returns or produces. Use this to explain results.
7.  **Synthesize Response:**
    *   Provide a clear, concise textual explanation.
    *   If code is requested or appropriate, generate a practical, runnable code snippet. Base this heavily on the `use` field of the most relevant AIU(s), customized with necessary inputs derived from the user's query and the AIU's `in` field.
    *   Ensure the code is appropriate for the programming language context implied by the `llm_min.txt` content (usually Python, but adapt if examples suggest otherwise).
8.  **Acknowledge Limitations:** The `llm_min.txt` content is focused on common, practical usage. If a user query is for a very specific, advanced, or obscure detail not well-covered by the AIUs, it's appropriate to state that the information for that precise edge case isn't detailed in the `llm_min.txt`. Offer the closest available pattern or information. **Do not invent functionality not described in the `llm_min.txt` content.**
