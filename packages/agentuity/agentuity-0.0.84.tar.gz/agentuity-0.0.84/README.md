# Agentuity Python SDK


**Visit [https://agentuity.com](https://agentuity.com) to get started with Agentuity.**



The Agentuity Python SDK is a powerful toolkit for building, deploying, and managing AI agents in Python environments. This SDK provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools to create intelligent, event-driven agents that can process various types of content, communicate with each other, and integrate with external systems.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Build and orchestrate multiple interconnected agents that can communicate and collaborate.
- **Event-Driven Design**: Respond to various triggers including webhooks, cron jobs, SMS, voice, email, and more.
- **Rich Content Handling**: Process and generate multiple content types including JSON, text, markdown, HTML, and binary formats (images, audio, PDFs).
- **Persistent Storage**: Built-in key-value and vector storage capabilities for maintaining state and performing semantic searches.
- **Observability**: Integrated OpenTelemetry support for comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing.
- **Cross-Runtime Support**: Works seamlessly with both Node.js and Bun runtimes.

## Use Cases

- Building conversational AI systems
- Creating automated workflows with multiple specialized agents
- Developing content processing and generation pipelines
- Implementing intelligent data processing systems
- Building AI-powered APIs and services

## Getting Started

To use this SDK in a real project, you should install the Agentuity CLI.

```bash
curl -sSL https://agentuity.sh/install.sh | bash
```


Once installed, you can create a new project with the following command:

```bash
agentuity new
```


## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.10 or 3.11)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (latest version recommended)


### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/agenuity/sdk-py.git
cd sdk-py

# Install dependencies using uv (recommended)
uv install
```

### Local Development

Create a minimal agentuity.yaml file in the root of the project:

```yaml
project_id: proj_mv0w67c4851eX0oTglYLzP3OgS2BjN54
name: test
agents:
  - id: agent_HaDpiH67c4851eISzbAWfZqwLtnpguW6
    name: myfirstagent
```

Create a test agent:

```bash
mkdir -p agents/myfirstagent
touch agents/myfirstagent/agent.py
```

Create a test agent:

```python
def run(request, response, context):
    return response.text("Hello, world")
```

Run the test server:

```bash
uv run test.py
```

Hit the test endpoint:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3500/agent_HaDpiH67c4851eISzbAWfZqwLtnpguW6 --json '{"hello":"world"}'
```
