# A merge tree (sometimes also called a split tree, and related to contour
# trees) is associated with a graph G and a function f on the nodes of G.  This
# tree consists of a number of *segments*, each of which is associated with one
# or more nodes of G. Each segment also has a *birth level* and a *death level*,
# as well as 0 or more *parents* and 0 or 1 *children*. (This terminology may be
# a bit backwards from what you expect for trees, in that parent segments join
# together to produce a single child. The motivation for this is that if we use
# this terminology, a parent is born before its children.)

# A fundamental property of a merge tree is that if you choose a threshold value
# t and select all segments alive at time t, these correspond with the connected
# components of the subgraph of G consisting of nodes for which f(v) > t.
# The idea is that the branches of the merge tree track how connected components
# of the superlevel sets of f merge together as we reduce the threshold.

# The structure of the merge tree is perhaps simplest to explain by describing the
# algorithm for constructing one. We start with an empty tree, and iterate
# through the nodes of G in decreasing value of f. For each node v, we look at all
# of its neighboring nodes and their associated segments, if any. Three things
# can happen:
# 1. The node is not adjacent to any active segments
# 2. The node is adjacent to nodes in exactly one active segment s
# 3. The node is adjacent to nodes in more than one active segment, a set we will call N
# In case 1, we create a new segment, with birth value f(v), and mark it as active.
# In case 2, we add v to the segment s and continue.
# In case 3, we merge the segments v is adjacent to by doing the following:
# - mark each segment s' in N as inactive, and give it death value f(v)
# - create a new segment s, containing v and all nodes in the segments in N.
# - mark s as the child of each segment in N
# - add N as the set of parents of s.

# data structure: collection of branches. each branch has a birth and death
# time, the nodes contained in the branch immediately before death, and a
# reference to a successor branch.

# what do we do with the nodes that cause death? one option is to just add them
# to the successor branch but not represent them anywhere else.

# the algorithm should work by adding nodes in order of function values.  when a
# node is added, we can create a new branch with only that node and the
# appropriate birth time, add the node to a branch, or kill two or more branches
# and create a new branch which is a successor branch. this can result in
# branches of length 0, which we then need to clean up.

    # The stability of a segment in the merge tree that is born at $b$ and dies
    # at $d$ is equal to \sum_v min(f(v), b) - d

    # The idea is that we want clusters that contain a lot of nodes that stick
    # around for a long time. The largest value stability can take is N * (b - d),
    # where N is the number of nodes in the branch.  It can take values arbitrarily
    # close to b - d, if all but one node join just before the death level.
    # The interpretation of the score obviously depends on the range/distribution of f.

    # "good" clusters look like a group of nodes that all join fairly early and stay
    # together for a while before the cluster merges with another one. If a cluster
    # only sticks around for a little while, we probably either want to use its
    # parents or its child.

    # We also add the option for a multiplicative weight on each node, for a
    # couple of reasons.
    # One is that each node can represent a different number of data points, and it
    # probably makes sense to measure stability by number of data points included
    # and not just the number of nodes.
    # The other is that we also want to emphasize clusters with high values of the
    # failure function, not just clusters that persist across a wide range of values
    # of the failure function. So we can use a weight to tip the scales toward
    # clusters with high failure values.

    # Choosing branches to return is done by selecting a disjoint set of branches
    # whose total stability is as large as possible. This can be done by starting at
    # the initial branches and moving downwards in the tree, selecting a child
    # branch only if that branch's stability is greater than the sum of its
    # parents'.
