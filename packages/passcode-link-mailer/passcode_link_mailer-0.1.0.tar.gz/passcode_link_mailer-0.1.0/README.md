# Simple Passcode Mailer

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/simple-passcode-mailer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/simple-passcode-mailer) 
* A straightforward Python library to send email confirmations via Gmail using **App Passwords**. 
* It generates a unique passcode, embeds it in a customizable HTML email template with a confirmation link, and handles sending the email. 
* Ideal for simple email verification flows where you want to manage the email sending process directly.

## Key Features

* **Gmail Focused:** Designed specifically for sending emails through Gmail using Google App Passwords.
* **Secure Passcodes:** Generates cryptographically strong, URL-safe passcodes using Python's `secrets` module.
* **Customizable HTML Emails:** Comes with a decent default HTML template, but you provide the main message body and subject, which can include placeholders.
* **Timed Validity:** Set an expiration duration for how long the generated passcode and link should be considered valid.
* **Optional Delayed Sending:** Emails can be sent immediately or after a specified delay using a background daemon thread.
* **Pure Python:** Relies only on Python standard libraries, so no external dependencies to install beyond the library itself.
* **Clear Error Handling:** Uses custom exceptions to help you pinpoint issues with authentication, connection, or other sending errors.

# IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual credentials and application details.
# It's recommended to load sensitive credentials from environment variables or a secure config.

GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD = "abcd efgh ijkl mnop"    # Your 16-character Gmail App Password (no spaces)
TEST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL = "the.jar.team2025+mee@gmail.com" # Email address to send the test to, if you didnt know you can use + in mails and they act as tags in mails
