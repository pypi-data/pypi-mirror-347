    A class to generate stratified K-fold splits for training and testing data.

    Attributes:
        rc_data (object): An object containing x_train and y_train as DataFrames.
        folds_count (int): Number of folds for cross-validation.
        x_train_folds (list): Stores the training feature sets for each fold.
        x_test_folds (list): Stores the testing feature sets for each fold.
        y_train_folds (list): Stores the training target sets for each fold.
        y_test_folds (list): Stores the testing target sets for each fold.
        X (DataFrame): The input features from rc_data.
        y (DataFrame): The target variable from rc_data.
        y_stratify (Series): The column used for stratification in cross-validation.
