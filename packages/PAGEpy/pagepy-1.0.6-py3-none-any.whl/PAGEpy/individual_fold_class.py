class IndividualFold:
    """
    A class to prepare the data for training and testing an Artificial Neural Network 
    using the stratified folds from an existing fold object.
    
    Attributes:
        folds_object (object): The object containing the folds (e.g., rcFolds).
        current_fold (int): The index of the current fold to be used for training and testing.
        unique_combinations_array (array): An array of unique combinations from the target variable.
        x_train (DataFrame or ndarray): The multidimensional gene expression array for the training set.
        genes_list (list): A list of genes used for subsetting the data.
        x_test (DataFrame or ndarray): The multidimensional gene expression array for the test set.
        y_train (DataFrame or Series): The dataframe of target variables for the training set.
        y_test_outcome (array): The numerical categories of the outcome for the test set.

        Initializes the RcFoldForANN object with the data from the specified fold.
