     Warning: Please add a custom 'X-FoxAPI-App=MyAppName' header to your requests. This would help us fighting against DDoS attacks in future, while keeping your application's access to the API. In future, this may be a mandatory requirement.  To reduce the system load, the API endpoints are rate limited. The default limit is 20 requests per minute. Contact admin@orangefox.tech if you need a higher limit.  The requests may be logged for analytics and development purposes.
