class JSONGrapherRecord:
    """
    This class enables making JSONGrapher records. Each instance represents a structured JSON record for a graph.
    One can optionally provide an existing JSONGrapher record during creation to pre-populate the object.
    One can also manipulate the fig_dict inside, directly, using syntax like Record.fig_dict["comments"] = ...

    Arguments & Attributes (all are optional):
        comments (str): Can be used to put in general description or metadata related to the entire record. Can include citation links. Goes into the record's top level comments field.
        datatype: The datatype is the experiment type or similar, it is used to assess which records can be compared and which (if any) schema to compare to. Use of single underscores between words is recommended. This ends up being the datatype field of the full JSONGrapher file. Avoid using double underscores '__' in this field  unless you have read the manual about hierarchical datatypes. The user can choose to provide a URL to a schema in this field, rather than a dataype name.
        graph_title: Title of the graph or the dataset being represented.
        data_objects_list (list): List of data series dictionaries to pre-populate the record. These may contain 'simulate' fields in them to call javascript source code for simulating on the fly.
        simulate_as_added: Boolean. True by default. If true, any data series that are added with a simulation field will have an immediate simulation call attempt.
        x_data: Single series x data in a list or array-like structure. 
        y_data: Single series y data in a list or array-like structure.
        x_axis_label_including_units: A string with units provided in parentheses. Use of multiplication "*" and division "/" and parentheses "( )" are allowed within in the units . The dimensions of units can be multiple, such as mol/s. SI units are expected. Custom units must be inside  < > and at the beginning.  For example, (<frogs>*kg/s)  would be permissible. Units should be non-plural (kg instead of kgs) and should be abbreviated (m not meter). Use “^” for exponents. It is recommended to have no numbers in the units other than exponents, and to thus use (bar)^(-1) rather than 1/bar.
        y_axis_label_including_units: A string with units provided in parentheses. Use of multiplication "*" and division "/" and parentheses "( )" are allowed within in the units . The dimensions of units can be multiple, such as mol/s. SI units are expected. Custom units must be inside  < > and at the beginning.  For example, (<frogs>*kg/s)  would be permissible.

It is recommended to have no numbers in the units other than exponents, and to thus use (bar)^(-1) rather than 1/bar.
        layout: A dictionary defining the layout of the graph, including axis titles,
                comments, and general formatting options.
    
    Methods:
        add_data_series: Adds a new data series to the record.
        set_layout: Updates the layout configuration for the graph.
        export_to_json_file: Saves the entire record (comments, datatype, data, layout) as a JSON file.
