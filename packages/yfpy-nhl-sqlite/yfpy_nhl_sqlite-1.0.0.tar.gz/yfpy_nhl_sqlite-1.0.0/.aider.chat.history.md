I'll complete the SQL queries in scratch.sql by adding SELECT * statements for all the remaining tables from schema.sql, and I'll remove the AI comment.

scratch.sql
```sql
<<<<<<< SEARCH
SELECT
  *
FROM
  player
SELECT
  -- Keep adding these SELECT * queries for all tables in my schema.sql file, AI!

SELECT
  *

  player;

SELECT

SELECT

SELECT

I'll fix the SQL syntax errors in the scratch.sql file. The main issues are missing semicolons at the end of some SELECT statements.

scratch.sql
```sql
<<<<<<< SEARCH
SELECT
  *
FROM
  metadata
SELECT
=======
SELECT
  *
FROM
  metadata;

SELECT
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

scratch.sql
```sql
<<<<<<< SEARCH
FROM
  stat
SELECT
=======
FROM
  stat;

SELECT
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes add the missing semicolons to properly terminate the SQL statements for the metadata and stat tables.

#### /add queries.py  
> Added queries.py to the chat  

#### Can you tell me what places in my queries.py file I could add debug logging?  

I'll identify places in your `queries.py` file where you could add debug logging. Here are the key places where adding debug logging would be valuable:

1. In the `_refresh_yahoo_query` method to log when the Yahoo query is refreshed
2. In the `import_data` method to log the start of each import phase
3. In the `_get_player_id_from_external_data` method to improve the existing logging
4. In the `_find_player_id_by_toi` method to log TOI matching attempts
5. In the `_write_player_external_ids` method to log the number of players matched

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to add these debug logs:

queries.py
```python
