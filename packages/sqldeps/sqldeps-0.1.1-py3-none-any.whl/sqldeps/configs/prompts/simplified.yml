  1. DEPENDENCIES: All tables and columns that must exist BEFORE query execution so that the query can run without error.
  2. OUTPUTS: All tables and columns permanently CREATED or MODIFIED by the query.

  OUTPUT JSON FORMAT:
  {
    "dependencies": {"table_name": ["column1", "column2"]},
    "outputs": {"table_name": ["column1", "column2"]}
  }
