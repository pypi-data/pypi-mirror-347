    Configuration for getaddrinfo DNS resolver. This resolver will use the system's getaddrinfo()
    function to resolve hosts.

    .. attention::

      This resolver uses a single background thread to do resolutions. As such, it is not currently
      advised for use in situations requiring a high resolution rate. A thread pool can be added
      in the future if needed.

    .. attention::

      Resolutions currently use a hard coded TTL of 60s because the getaddrinfo() API does not
      provide the actual TTL. Configuration for this can be added in the future if needed.
