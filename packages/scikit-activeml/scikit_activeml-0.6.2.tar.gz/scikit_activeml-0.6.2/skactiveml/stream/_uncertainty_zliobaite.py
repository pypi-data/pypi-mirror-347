class UncertaintyZliobaite(SingleAnnotatorStreamQueryStrategy):
    """Base class for the uncertainty sampling strategies proposed by Žliobaitė
    et al. in [1]_.

    The UncertaintyZliobaite class provides the base for query strategies
    proposed by Žliobaitė et al. in [1]_. The strategies evaluate the
    classifier's uncertainty based on its predictions and samples' labels are
    queried when the uncertainty exceeds a specific threshold. Žliobaitė et al.
    propose various techniques to calculate such a threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    budget_manager : BudgetManager, default=None
        The BudgetManager which models the budgeting constraint used in the
        stream-based active learning setting. if set to `None`, a default
        budger manager will be used.  The budget manager will be initialized
        based on the following conditions:

        - If only a `budget` is given, the default budget manager is
          initialized with the given budget.
        - If only a budget manager is given, use the budget manager.
        - If both are not given, the default budget manager with the default
          budget.
        - If both are given, and the budget differs from
          `budgetmanager.budget`, throw a warning and the budget manager is
          used as is.
    budget : float, default=None
        Specifies the ratio of samples which are allowed to be sampled, with
        `0 <= budget <= 1`. If `budget` is `None`, it is replaced with the
        default budget 0.1.
    random_state : int or RandomState instance, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the estimator.

    uncertainty assessed based on the classifier's predictions. The sample is
    queried when the probability of the most likely class exceeds a
    time-dependent threshold calculated based on the budget, and the number of
    observed and acquired samples. The threshold is randomized by being
    multiplied with a random number sampled from N(1,delta). See also
    :class:`.RandomVariableUncertaintyBudgetManager`

    Parameters
    ----------
    budget_manager : BudgetManager, default=None
        The BudgetManager which models the budgeting constraint used in the
        stream-based active learning setting. if set to `None`,
        `RandomVariableUncertaintyBudgetManager` will be used by default.  The
        budget manager will be initialized based on the following conditions:

        - If only a `budget` is given, the default budget manager is
          initialized with the given budget.
        - If only a budget manager is given, use the budget manager.
        - If both are not given, the default budget manager with the default
          budget.
        - If both are given, and the budget differs from
          `budgetmanager.budget`, throw a warning and the budget manager is
          used as is.
    budget : float, default=None
        Specifies the ratio of samples which are allowed to be sampled, with
        `0 <= budget <= 1`. If `budget` is `None`, it is replaced with the
        default budget 0.1.
    random_state : int or RandomState instance, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the estimator.
