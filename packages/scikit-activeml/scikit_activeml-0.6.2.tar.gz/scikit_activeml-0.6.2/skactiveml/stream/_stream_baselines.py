class StreamRandomSampling(SingleAnnotatorStreamQueryStrategy):
    """Random Sampling for Data Streams.

    The RandomSampling strategy queries labels completely randomly. The
    probability to query a sample is dependent on the budget specified in
    the budget manager. Given a budget of 10%, the utility exceeds 0.9 (1-0.1)
    with a probability of 10%. samples are queried regardless of their
    position in the feature space and disregards any information about the
    sample. Thus, it should only be used as a baseline strategy. The
    `allow_exceeding_budget` parameter allows to configure the strategy to
    strictly adhere to a given budget.

    Parameters
    ----------
    allow_exceeding_budget : bool, default=True
        If `True`, the query strategy is allowed to exceed it's budget as long
        as the average number of queries will be within the budget. If `False`,
        queries are not allowed if the budget is exhausted.
    budget : float, default=None
        The budget which models the budgeting constraint used in the
        stream-based active learning setting.
    random_state : int or RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the estimator.
