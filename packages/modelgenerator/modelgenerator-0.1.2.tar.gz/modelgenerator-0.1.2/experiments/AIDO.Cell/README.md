# AIDO.Cell

AIDO.Cell-100M is GenBio AIâ€™s SOTA cellular foundation model trained on 50 million cells over a diverse set of human tissues and organs. The AIDO.Cell models are capable of handling the entire human transcriptome as input, thus learning accurate and general representations of the human cell's entire transcriptional context. AIDO.Cell achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks such as zero-shot clustering, cell-type classification, and perturbation modeling.
