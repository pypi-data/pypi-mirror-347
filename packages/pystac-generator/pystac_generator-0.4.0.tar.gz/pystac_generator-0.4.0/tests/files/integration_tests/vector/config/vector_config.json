    "description": "Exposure of land to wind, and to some extent to the sun, on west facing slopes can significantly reduce productivity. Assessment of exposure is highly subjective, and is designed to do no more than signal that it is a factor to consider in certain situations. Exposure is simply assessed for the purposes of this classification by judging whether or not the land is unprotected by nearby high ground. Three Exposure attribute classes are considered: Y1, Y2, Y3. Assessments are based on an interpretation of Soil landscape map units which are categorised into legend categories according to the proportion of the landscape with the highest degree of exposure, provided that it accounts for at least 30% of the area of the map unit.",

These Soils (soil type) classes are also termed 'subgroup soils' in the reference text Hall et al. 2009, 'The Soils of Southern South Australia', where they are described in detail. Each of these soils has a two character alphanumeric code. The first character (letter) represents the relevant Soil GroupSELECT 1 FROM DUAL; the second character (number) represents a particular Soil within the Soil Group. Three additional miscellaneous classes (rock, water, not applicable) are also provided. Hence, 64 attribute (or 'analysis data') classes have been supplied, as percentage (areal extent) values of each possible soil type within each Soil Landscape Map Unit. Note: the sum of all percentage values for each map unit totals 100%. This analysis data is to be used for the creation of spatial data statistics. For map display purposes, the most commonly occurring Soil (SOIL_SUBGR legend category) is defined, however, it should be noted that this often accounts for less than 50% of a Soil Landscape Map Unit.",
