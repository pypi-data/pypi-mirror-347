        participants, :meth:`reset` being called between each participant.

        Each row of the resulting DataFrame corresponds to the state of one of the
        instances in the Agent at a particular time for a particular virtual participant.
        The columns in the DataFrame are

        ``iteration``
            the number of times :meth:`reset` has been called before recording the data in
            this row, which is typically an identifier for the virtual participant

        ``time``
            the :attr:`time` in this Agent at which the data in this row was recorded,
            typically the round of the task

        ``choice``
            the choice made in this round; if this Agent has attributes, the choice will
            be a tuple containing the values of the attributes in the order in which the
            attributes were declared when creating the Agent

        ``utility``
            the utility in this instance

        ``option``
            the option in this instance; note that this typically differs from the choice
            column as the choice is the choice made at this time while the option is the
            option in this instance, whether or not this instance contributed to the
            "winning" choice; however, as with choice, if the Agent was defined to have
            attributes the value in this column will be a tuple listing the values of
            those attributes in the order provided when the Agent was defined

        ``blended_value``
            the blended value computed for the option in this instance at this time; note
            that the same blended value is reported for each row corresponding to an
            instance with the same option at the same time and iteration

        ``retrieval_probability``
            the probability of retrieval of this instance at this time

        ``activation``
            the activation of this instance at this time

        ``base_level_activation``
            the base level term of the activation computation at this time

        ``activation_noise``
            the noise term of  the activation computation at this time

        If partial matching was used at least once in this Agent since the aggregate
        details started being record there will be additional columns following those
        above. The first, ``mismatch``, is the total mismatch penalty for this instance
        for this query. After this there is one column for each attribute that was
        partially matched, the similarity value computed for this attribute.

        Note that each time the ``aggregate_details`` attribute is queried a new DataFrame
        is created from an internal data structure. If you wish to modify a DataFrame and
        have those changes retained you need to retain this DataFrame.

        .. warning::
            Collecting ``aggregate_details`` incurs costs, both in space and time, and for
            large, complex models some thought may be needed to balance these costs
            against the value and convenience of the results.

        If provided, *when* should be a time, a dimensionless quantity, typically a count
        of the number of choose/respond cycles that have occurred since the agent was
        created or last :meth:`reset`; providing *time* will cause the instances to be
        added at that specified time instead of the current time. The *time* provided
        may not be in the future.

        This is typically used to enable startup of a model by adding instances before the
        first call to :meth:`choose`. When used in this way the timestamp associated with
        this occurrence of the instance will be zero. Subsequent occurrences are possible
        if :meth:`respond` is called with the same outcome after :meth:`choose` has
        returned the same decision in the same situation, in which case those reinforcing
        occurrences will have later timestamps. An alternative mechanism to facilitate
        sartup of a model is setting the :attr:`default_utility` property of the agent.
        While rarely done, a modeler can even combine the two mechanisms, if desired.

        It is also possible to call :meth:`populate` after choose/respond cycles have
        occurred. In this case the instances are added with the current time as the
        timestamp. This is one less than the timestamp that would be used were an instance
        to be added by being experienced as part of a choose/respond cycle instead. Each
        agent keeps internally a clock, the number of choose/respond cycles that have
        occurred since it was created or last :meth:`reset`. When :meth:`choose` is called
        it advances that clock by one *before* computing the activations of the existing
        instances, as it must since the activation computation depends upon all
        experiences having been in the past. That advanced clock is the timestamp used
        when an instance is added or reinforced by :meth:`respond`.

        The *when* argument, which if provided should be a time, can be used to add
        instances at other times.

        Raises a :exc:`ValueError` if *outcome* is not a :class:`Real` number, if any of
        the *choices* are malformed or duplicates, or if *when* is in the future.

        .. warning::
            In normal use you should only call :meth:`populate` before any choose/respond
            cycles. If, for exotic purposes, you do wish to call it after, caution should
            be exercised to avoid biologically implausible models. It should not normally
            be necessary to use the *when* argument, which is provided only for esoteric
            uses. In particular instances may not be added in the future, as that would
            result in tears as operations such as :meth:`choose` will raise
            an :exc:`Exception`.

        """Selects which of the *choices* is expected to result in the largest payoff, and returns it.
        The expected form of the *choices* depends upon whether or not this :class:`Agent`
        has any attributes or not. If it does not, each of the *choices* should be a
        :class:`Hashable` that is not ``None``, representing an atomic choice; if any of
        the *choices* are not hashable or are ``None`` a :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

        If this :class:`Agent` does have attributes (that is, the *attributes* argument
        was supplied and non-empty when it was created, or, equivalently, the value of the
        :attr:`attributes` property is a non-empty list), then each of the *choices* can
        be either a :class:`Mapping`, typically a :class:`dict`, mapping attribute names
        to their values, or a :class:`Sequence`, typically a :class:`list`, containing
        attribute values in the order they were declared when this :class:`Agent` was
        created and would be returned by :attr:`attributes`. Attributes not present
        (either there is no key in the :class:`Mapping`, or a :class:`Sequence` shorter
        than the number of attributes) have a value of `None`, while values not
        corresponding to attributes of the :class:`Agent` (either a key in the
        :class:`Mapping` that does not match an attribute name, or a :class:`Sequence`
        longer than the number of attributes) are ignored. Whether a :class:`Mapping` or a
        :class:`Sequence`, all the attribute values must be :class:`Hashable`, and are
        typically strings or numbers. If any of the *choices* do not have one of these
        forms a :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

        In either case, if any pair of the *choices* duplicate each other, even if of
        different forms (e.g. dictionary versus list), and after adding default ``None``
        values and removing ignored values, a :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

        It is also possible to supply no *choices*, in which case those used in the most
        recent previous call to this method are reused. If there was no such previous call
        since the last time this :class:`Agent` was :meth:`reset` a :exc:`ValueError` is
        raised.

        For each of the *choices* this method finds all instances in memory that match,
        and computes their activations at the current time based upon when in the past
        they have been seen, modified by the value of the :attr:`decay` property, and with
        noise added as controlled by the :attr:`noise` property. If partial matching has
        been enabled with :attr:`mismatch_penalty` such matching instances need not match
        exactly, and the similarities modified by the mismatch penalty are subtracted from
        the activations. If partial matching is not enabled only those instances that
        match exactly are consulted. "Exact" matches are based on Python's ``==``
        operator, not ``is``. Thus, for example ``0``, ``0.0`` and ``False`` all match one
        another, as do ``1``, ``1.0`` and ``True``.

        Looking at the activations of the whole ensemble of instances matching a choice a
        retrieval probability is computed for each possible outcome, and these are
        combined to arrive at a blended value expected for the choice. This blending
        operation depends upon the value of the :attr:`temperature` property; if none is
        supplied a default is computed based on the value of the :attr:`noise` parameter.
        The value chosen and returned is that element of *choices* with the highest
        blended value. In case of a tie one will be chosen at random.

        After a call to :attr:`choose` a corresponding call must be made to
        :meth:`respond` before calling :meth:`choose` again, or a :exc:`RuntimeError` will
        be raised.

        If the *details* argument is also supplied and is ``True`` two values are returned
        as a 2-tuple, the first as above and the second containing data used to arrive at
        the selection. While the comparison of blended values used by :meth:`choose` is
        the appropriate process for most models, for some specialized purposes the modeler
        may wish to implement a different decision procedure. This additional information,
        when combined with supplying a second argment to :meth:`respond`, facilitates the
        construction of such more complicated models.

        The second return value is a list of dicts, one for each choice. These dicts have
        entries for the choice, the blended value, and a list of retrieval probability
        descriptions. The retrieval probability descriptions are themselves dicts, one for
        each instance consulted in constructing the given choice's blended value. Each of
        these latter dicts has two entries, one for the utility stored in the instance and
        the other its probability of retrieval.

        Because of noise the results returned by :attr:`choose` are stochastic, so the
        results of running the following examples may differ in their details from those
        shown.

        decision with the given outcome, and is the fundamental way in which the PyIBL
        model "learns from experience."

        By default the choice selected by :meth:`choose` is the one to which the outcome
        is attached. In unusual cases, however, the modeler may prefer to select a
        different choice; for example, if using a different decision procedure based on
        the information returned by a ``True`` value of the second argument to
        :meth:`Choose`, or if performing model tracing of an individual human's behavior
        on the experiment being modeled. To support these unusual cases a second argument
        may be passed to :meth:`respond`, which is the choice to actually be made. If it
        is not one of the choices provided in the original call to :meth:`choose` a
        ``ValueError`` is raised.

        It is also possible to delay feedback, by calling :meth:`respond` without
        arguments, or with the first argument being ``None``. This tells the
        :class:`Agent` to assume it has received feedback equal to that it expected, that
        is, the blended value resulting from past experiences. In this case
        :meth:`respond` returns a value, a :class:`DelayedRespone` object, which can be
        used subsequently to update the response.

        .. warning::
            Delayed feedback is an experimental feature and care should be exercised in
            its use to avoid biologically implausible models.

        was called a :exc:`RuntimeError` is raised. If *outcome* is neither ``None`` nor a

        over all the virtual participants. The *kind* argument to :meth:`plot` should be
        a string, one of the following

        ``"choice"``
            a plot of the number of times various choices are made by the model as a
            function of time

        ``"bv"``
            a plot of the blended values of the options considered as a function of time

        ``"probability"``
            a plot of the probabilities of retrieval of the various instances as a function
            of time

        ``"activation"``
            a plot of the activations of the various instances as a function of time

        ``"baselevel"``
            a plot of the base level term in the activation computations of the various
            instances as a function of time

        ``"mismatch"``
            the total mismatch penalty terms in the activation computations of the various
            instances as a function of time

        concatenated with ``".similarity"``, which will produce a plot of the average
        similarity value of this attribute's value to that sought as a function of time.

        Whether or not the plot is displayed and/or saved to a file can be specified with
        the optional arguments *show* (a Boolean) and *filename* (a string). If *show* is
        not provided, by default the file will be displayed if and only if no *filename* is
        provided. In addition the plot is always returned by this method as a
        `matplotlib Figure <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.figure.html>`_.

        Details of the plot can be manipulated with several other optional arguments to
        :meth:`plot`:

        *title*
            the title applied to the plot

        *xlabel* and *ylabel*
            the labels of the corresponding axes of the plot

        *include*and *exclude*
            these should be lists of options; if *include* is provided only options in
            this list are displayed; any options in *exclude* are not displayed; if an
            option appears in both lists it is not displayed

        *min* and *max*
            these should be Real numbers; if *min* is supplied only results for instances
            with a utility greater or equal to this value are displayed; if *max* is
            supplied only results for instances with a utility less than or equal to this
            value are displayed

        *earliest* and *latest*
            these should be Real numbers; if *earliest* is supplied only results at this
            time or later are displayed; if *latest* is supplied only results at this time
            or earlier are displayed

        *legend*
            if ``True`` a legend is displayed on the plot; if ``False`` no legend is
            displayed; other values can also be supplied, which are passed on to
            `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.legend.html>`_;
            by default a legend is shown only if there are not so many items in the plot
            that the legend would likely overflow the available space

        *limits*
            this should be a list or tuple of two Real numbers, the smallest and greatest
            values of the Y axis of the plot; if not supplied suitable defaults are
            assumed

        Since :meth:`plot` always returns a Figure, more sophisticated manipulations can
        be made of it and the result displayed explicitly.

        should be empty or omitted.

        The *function* argument should be a ``Callable``, taking two arguments, or
        ``True``. The similarity value returned should be a real number between zero and
        one, inclusive. If ``True`` is passed as the value of *function* a default
        similarity function is used which returns one if its two arguments are ``==`` and
        zero otherwise. If, when called, the function returns a number outside that range
        a :exc:`RuntimeError` is raised. If, when the similarity function is called, the

        Similarity functions are only called when the `Agent` has a
        :attr:`mismatch_penalty` specified. When a similarity function is called it is
        passed two arguments, attribute values to compare. The function should be
        commutative; that is, if called with the same arguments in the reverse order, it
        should return the same value. It should also be stateless, always returning the
        same values if passed the same arguments. If either of these constraints is

        If one of *function* or *weight* is omitted or ``None`` but the other is supplied,

        In the following examples the height and width are assumed to range from zero to
        ten, and similarity of either is computed linearly, as the difference between them
