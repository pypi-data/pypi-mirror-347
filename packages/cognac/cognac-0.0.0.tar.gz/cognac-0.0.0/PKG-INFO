## 🚧 [Documentation](https://cognac-marl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is in progress.

COGNAC is a Python-based benchmark suite offering **flexible**, **graph-structured**, **cooperative multi-agent** environments for MARL research. The package offers standardized minimal implementations of several well-known theoretical **graph-based MARL problems** taken from the literature, adapted for empirical benchmarking with modern RL tooling.

🎯 Benchmark example available [here](https://github.com/yojul/cognac-benchmark-example)
