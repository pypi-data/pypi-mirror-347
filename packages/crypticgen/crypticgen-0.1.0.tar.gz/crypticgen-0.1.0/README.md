# CrypticGen 🔐

***CrypticGen*** is a powerful, secure and customisable password generation and management utility for Python.

## Features

- Generate strong, cryptographically secure passwords
- Customize character sets (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)
- Inclsion & Exclusion of characters
- Default exclusion of confusing characters (customizable)
- Evaluate password strength
- Generate URL-safe tokens
- Output SHA-256 hashed passwords
- Store and retrieve generated passwords
- Command-line interface for easy use
- Encrypt & Decrypt the password
- Check for password breach through k-Anonymity method (HIBP)

## Installation

```bash
pip install crypticgen
```

## Command Line Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate a default 04-character password
crypticgen

# Generate a 16-character password
crypticgen --length 16
```

### Character Set Options

```bash
# No symbols
crypticgen --no-symbols

# Excxludes lowercase & symbols from password
crypticgen --no-lowercase --no-symbols

# Exclude specified characters
crypticgen --exclude "0O1Il"

# Add custom characters
crypticgen --custom "!@#$%"
```

### Multiple Passwords

```bash
# Generate 5 passwords
crypticgen --number 5
```

### Output Formats

```bash
# Generate hashed password (SHA-256)
crypticgen --hash

# Generate URL-safe token
crypticgen --url-safe

# Don't show password strength
crypticgen --no-strength
```

### Managing Stored Passwords

```bash
# List all stored passwords
crypticgen --list

# Delete a password by ID
crypticgen --delete 3
```


### Python API Usage ###

```python
from crypticgen import CrypticGen

# Create a PassKey instance
pk = CrypticGen(
    length=16,
    include_uppercase=True,  # includes uppercase characters if True
    include_lowercase=True,  # includes lowercase characters if True
    include_digits=True,    # includes digits if True
    include_symbols=True,   # includes symbols if True
    exclude_char="0O1Il",  # Exclude specified characters if mentioned
    custom_chars="",    # Add custom characters if mentioned
    hash_format=False,  # Output SHA-256 hash if True
    url_safe=False,     # Generate URL-safe token if True
    default_exclude = r"[\\,\'\"\.`1I|]"   # excludes confusing characters by default. Can be customisable  
)

# Generate a password
password = pk.generate()
print(f"Generated password: {password}")

# Check password strength
strength = pk.password_strength(password)
print(f"Password strength: {strength}")

# Generate multiple passwords
multiple_passwords = pk.bulk_generate(5)
print(multiple_passwords)

# Verify a password
if pk.verify(password):
    print("Password verified!")


# Password Breach Checker through HIBP API
check = pk.password_breach(password)
print(check)
## 🔑 Password Breach Check (Have I Been Pwned Integration) ##
crypticgen uses the official [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API (https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{first 5 hash chars}) to safely and securely check if a password has appeared in known data breaches.
This feature uses the [k-Anonymity model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity), meaning your full password or full hash is **never sent over the internet**, ensuring maximum privacy and safety.

# Password encryption & decryption
encrypted = pk.encryption(password)
print(encrypted)
decrypted = pk.decrypted(encrypted)
print(decrypted)
