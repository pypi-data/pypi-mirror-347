# resp_protein_toolkit

A toolkit designed to perform some common tasks in protein
engineering, especially encoding protein sequences (in various
formats), assisting in fitting uncertainty-aware models to
data, and using a trained model to search for improved candidates
using the RESP pipeline from [Parkinson et al. 2023 (Nature
Communications).](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36028-8)

For an example of the full RESP pipeline, including uncertainty-aware
model training, please [see this repo.](https://github.com/Wang-lab-UCSD/RESP)
