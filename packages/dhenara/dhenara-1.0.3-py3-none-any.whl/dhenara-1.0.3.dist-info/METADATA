# dhenara (DEPRECATED)

**⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE ⚠️**

This package has been renamed to [`dhenara-ai`](https://pypi.org/project/dhenara-ai/).

Please update your dependencies to use the new package:

```bash
pip install dhenara-ai
```

## No Code Changes Required

Your existing code will continue to work without changes:

```python
# This will still work with either package installed
import dhenara.ai
```

## Why the Change?

We've renamed the package to better reflect its focus on AI capabilities and to avoid naming conflicts. The `dhenara-ai` package contains all the same functionality as before.


### Package Family
We're expanding the ecosystem with related packages:

- **`dhenara-ai`**: The core package (formerly known as dhenara)
- **`dhenara-agent`**: Our new agent framework package built on top of `dhenara-ai`
You can install them separately or together depending on your needs.

## About Dhenara-AI

Dhenara is a genuinely open source Python package for interacting with various AI models in a unified way. It is a lightweight, straightforward framework for integrating multiple AI models into Python applications. It's similar in spirit to LangChain but with a focus on simplicity and minimal dependencies along with type safety using Pydantic Models.

### Key Features

- **Genuinely Open Source**: Built from the ground up as a community resource, not an afterthought or internal tool
- **Unified API**: Interact with different AI providers through a consistent interface
- **Type Safety**: Built with Pydantic for robust type checking and validation
- **Easy Regeneration across Providers**: With a unified Pydantic output and built-in prompt formatting, send output from a model to any other model easily
- **Streaming**: First-class support for streaming responses along with accumulated responses similar to non-streaming responses
- **Async Support**: Both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces for maximum flexibility
- **Resource Management**: Automatic handling of connections, retries, and timeouts
- **Foundation Models**: Pre-configured models with sensible defaults
- **Test Mode**: Bring up your app with dummy responses for streaming and non-streaming generation
- **Cost/Usage Data**: Derived cost and usage data along with responses, with optional charge for each model endpoint for commercial deployment
- **Community-Oriented Design**: An architecture separating API credentials, models, and configurations for flexible deployment and scaling

## Automatic Redirection

This package now serves as a thin compatibility layer that automatically installs and imports from `dhenara-ai`. However, it will display deprecation warnings to encourage users to migrate to the new package name.
