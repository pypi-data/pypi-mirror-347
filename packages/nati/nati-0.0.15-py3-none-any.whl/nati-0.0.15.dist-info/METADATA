# NATI Core – Network Analytics and Telemetry Interface

**NATI** (Network Analytics and Telemetry Interface) is a Python library designed to streamline the collection of network data from a wide range of devices. Built for network engineers and architects, NATI provides a unified interface for gathering telemetry, configurations, and real-time metrics using SSH (Netmiko) and API integrations (including Cisco ACI).

## Features:
- **Multi-vendor support** – Works with Cisco devices and other network infrastructure.
- **Flexible data retrieval** – Leverages SSH, APIs, and other protocols.
- **Designed for automation** – Easily integrates into existing network monitoring and automation workflows.
- **Built for scale** – Optimized for enterprise environments.

Whether you're auditing configurations, troubleshooting issues, or building network intelligence, **NATI** simplifies the process of gathering and analyzing network data.
