# Cylestio Monitor Security

## Secure Usage Guidelines

This document outlines best practices for using Cylestio Monitor securely in your applications.

### Authentication and API Keys

- **Use environment variables for credentials**
  Always store API keys and other sensitive information in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in your source code.

- **Follow least privilege principles**
  When setting up API access, use the minimum permissions necessary for your use case.

- **Rotate credentials regularly**
  Establish a process for regular credential rotation, especially in production environments.

## Credential Best Practices

```python
# Recommended secure usage
import os
from cylestio_monitor import Monitor

# DO NOT: monitor = Monitor(api_key="key-123456")
# INSTEAD:
monitor = Monitor(api_key=os.environ.get("CYLESTIO_API_KEY"))
```

For environment variable management, consider using `.env` files with a package like `python-dotenv`, but ensure these files are:
- Never committed to source control (add to `.gitignore`)
- Restricted with appropriate file permissions
- Different for each environment (development, staging, production)

## Dependencies and Updates

- Keep the SDK updated to the latest version to receive security patches
- Run dependency vulnerability scanners regularly in your CI/CD pipeline
- Subscribe to security announcements for major dependencies

## Data Handling

- Be cautious about what data is passed through the monitoring agent
- Avoid sending sensitive information in plaintext
- Consider implementing data redaction for sensitive fields
