# OpenAI Token Tracking Fix

## Problems Identified

1. **Dynamic Client Creation**: Our monitoring wasn't correctly tracking token usage for OpenAI clients created after the initial monitoring setup, especially in the customer support agent example.

2. **Token Extraction Logic**: The `_extract_chat_response_data` method wasn't robust enough to handle various response formats from the OpenAI API, especially for response structures from newer versions.

3. **Event Converter Issues**: The OpenAI and Anthropic event converters had issues with the StandardizedEvent class parameters:
   - `event_category` parameter was being passed but is no longer accepted by the constructor
   - Anthropic converter was using `event_type` instead of the correct `name` parameter

4. **Event Logging Issues**: After fixing the log_event and log_error functions to handle agent_id differently, we found that:
   - Several patchers were still passing agent_id explicitly, causing errors when initializing tools
   - LangChainPatcher was missing the required 'patch' method implementation

5. **Output Path Issues**: The customer support agent was writing log files to the wrong location due to incorrect path handling.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Improved OpenAI Patching**:
   - Enhanced the patcher to properly intercept all client instance creations
   - Made token usage extraction more robust across different response formats
   - Fixed path handling in the customer support agent

2. **Event Converter Fixes**:
   - Removed the deprecated `event_category` parameter
   - Updated the Anthropic converter to use the correct `name` parameter

3. **Patcher Fixes**:
   - Removed explicit agent_id parameter from log_event and log_error calls across all patchers
   - Fixed the LangChainPatcher class to implement the required 'patch' method
   - Updated the BaseTool.__call__ patching to work with the new logging interface

4. **Path Handling**:
   - Modified the customer support agent to use the correct output directory path

## Testing

1. **Unit Tests**: All tests pass with the updated code
2. **Integration Tests**: Successfully tested with both example agents
3. **Error Handling**: Added better error reporting when patching fails

## Version Update

- Updated version from 0.1.10 to 0.1.11 to reflect these changes

## Future Improvements

1. **Documentation**: Add more examples showing how token usage is tracked for different client usage patterns
2. **Consistency**: Consider standardizing the approach between Anthropic and OpenAI implementations
3. **Testing**: Add more comprehensive tests for different client creation patterns

## Impact

This fix improves reliability of token tracking for all users, especially those who:
- Create clients dynamically throughout their application lifecycle
- Use frameworks that might create new clients internally
- Have complex applications with multiple components that might each create their own clients

The improvements ensure that Cylestio Monitor provides accurate token usage metrics regardless of how client instances are created or used in the application.
