  * based on sorted dict
  * not used so far, but maybe useful in importing the long read bam files since it can be extended easily
* New: added decorators "experimental" and "deprecated" to mark unsafe functions
* Change: in differential splicing changed the alternative fraction, to match the common PSI (% spliced in) definition

* New: differential splicing result contains "novel", indicating that the the alternative is in the annotation
* New: added alternative TSS/alternative PAS to the differential splicing test
