# `fmtversion`:  Simple version variables for Python packages

Converts version information into a string `__version__` and a named tuple
`__version_info__` suitable for Python packages.  The approach is inspired
by PEP 440 and `sys.version_info`:

  * https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440

  * https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html

Versions of the form "major.minor.micro" are supported, with an optional,
numbered dev/alpha/beta/candidate/final/post status.  The module does not
support more complicated version numbers like "1.0b2.post345.dev456", since
this does not fit into a named tuple of the form used by `sys.version_info`.
The code is written as a single module, so that it may be bundled into
packages, rather than needing to be installed as a separate dependency.

Typical usage in a package's `version.py` with a bundled `fmtversion.py`:

```
from .fmtversion import get_version_plus_info
__version__, __version_info__ = get_version_plus_info(1, 2, 0, 'final', 0)
```

Following `sys.version_info`, `get_version_plus_info()` takes arguments
for a five-component version number:  major, minor, micro, release level, and
serial.  The release level may be any of dev, alpha, beta, candidate, final, or
post, or common variations/abbreviations thereof.  All arguments but
release level must be convertable to integers.

If only `__version__` or `__version_info__` is desired, then the functions
`get_version()` or `get_version_info()` may be used instead.  If a micro
version is not needed (`<major>.<minor>.<micro>`), then set the optional
keyword argument `usemicro=False`.  This will omit a micro version from the
string `__version__`, while the named tuple `__version_info__` will still
have a field `micro` that is set to zero to simplify comparisons.  If each
release level will only have one release, then set `useserial=False`.  This
will omit a serial number from the string `__version__`, while the
named tuple `__version_info__` will still have a field `serial` that is set
to zero.
