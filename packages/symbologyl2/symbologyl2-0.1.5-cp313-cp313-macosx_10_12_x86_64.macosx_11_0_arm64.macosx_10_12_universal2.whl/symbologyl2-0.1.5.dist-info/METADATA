# Symbology Normalization (symbologyl2-py)

## Introduction

Utility functions for parsing, normalizing, and translating between various capital market symbology types. This
library is a thin wrapper over the [symbologyl2](https://github.com/onechronos/symbologyl2) library, written in rust.

## Current Support

- [x] US equities
  - [x] CMS Concatenated/Suffix
  - [x] Nasdaq Integrated
  - [x] CQS (NYSE/CTA plan)

## Development

```
uv sync && uv sync --dev
source .venv/bin/activate
maturin develop
```

### Version Bumps

Given how [maturin](https://pyo3.rs/v0.17.3/index.html) operates, it's necessary to bump release versions in both
`pyproject.toml` and `Cargo.toml`.

```
pyproject.toml

[project]
version = "x.y.z"
```

```
Cargo.toml

[package]
version = "x.y.z"
```
