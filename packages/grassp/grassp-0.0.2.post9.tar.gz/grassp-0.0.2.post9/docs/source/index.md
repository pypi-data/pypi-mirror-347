# grassp - Graph-based analysis of subcellular proteomics data

Grassp is a python package for to perform scalable analysis of subcellular proteomics data (i.e. data that was produced using enrichment protocols for different cellular compartments, followed by mass-spectrometry). Grassp aims to be easy to use for researchers that are familiar with single-cell transcriptomics analysis in the [scverse](https://scverse.org/) ecosystem. Similar to [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), Grassp provides functions that manipulate [anndata](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) objects.
