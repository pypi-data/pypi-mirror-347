# Installation

For the moment, the package is not available on PyPI, so you need to install it from source.
We recommend using a conda environment to install the package.

```{code-block} bash
git clone https://github.com/czbiohub-sf/grassp.git
cd grassp
conda create -n grassp python=3.10
conda activate grassp
pip install -e .
```
