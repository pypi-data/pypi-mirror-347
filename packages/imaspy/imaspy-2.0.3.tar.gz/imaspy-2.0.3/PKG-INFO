# README

IMASPy and the Python interface of the Access-Layer have had a breaking change
to future-proof development. As such, the Python interface of the Access-Layer
is deprecated, and the IMASPy package is now called `imas` on ITER
infrastructure. The main repository can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/iterorganization/imas-python)
This means users will have to change their codes. Most notably:

## Migration guide
1. Add `imas-python` as a dependency of your project
    (see <https://pypi.org/project/imas-python/>)
2. Rename all your Python imports from `import imaspy.xyz` to `import imas.xyz`

## Rationale
1. The legacy IMAS Python interface of the Access-Layer is no longer supported
    by ITER
2. IMAS-Python is the successor, the new Python module is called `imas`
