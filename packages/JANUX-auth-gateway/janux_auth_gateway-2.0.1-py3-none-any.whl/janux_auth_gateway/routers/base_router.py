"""
base_router.py

Defines the base API routes for the JANUX Authentication Gateway.

Endpoints:
- `/`: Root endpoint to welcome users.
- `/health`: Health check endpoint to verify service status.

Features:
- Lightweight and essential routes for service interaction.
- Provides a health check mechanism to monitor service availability.
- Logs API accesses for better monitoring and debugging.
- Ensures readiness and liveness probes for containerized environments.
