-----

Sigmatcher is a powerful tool designed to automate the process of matching Java classes and methods across different
versions of an application.
It leverages signature on the smali (disassembled java code) to identify and correlate code elements, making it an
invaluable resource for long-running reverse engineering projects.

## Installation

Before installing `sigmatcher`, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- `ripgrep`: A command-line search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern.
  Install `ripgrep` by following the instructions on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).
- `apktool`: A tool for reverse engineering and disassembling Android apk files.
  Install `apktool` by following the instructions on its [official website](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/).

```console
git clone https://github.com/oriori1703/sigmatcher.git
pip install ./sigmatcher
```

## Quick Usage

To get started with sigmatcher, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Signature File**: Signature files (.yaml) define the patterns and signatures that Sigmatcher will use to
   analyze the APK files.
   These files should specify the classes, methods, and fields you're interested in, along with any version-specific
   information. See the [Creating Signature Files](#creating-signature-files) section example for the format.
2. **Analyze an APK**: With your signature file ready, you can now analyze an APK to find matches for your signatures.
   Use the sigmatcher analyze command, specifying the path to the APK and the signature file(s):

   ```shell
   sigmatcher analyze --apk path/to/your/app.apk --signatures path/to/your/signature_file.yaml
   ```

   This command will decode the APK, apply the signatures, and output the analysis results, highlighting matched
   classes, methods and fields.

## Creating Signature Files

Signature files are YAML formatted documents that `sigmatcher` uses to identify and match Java classes, methods, and
fields in APK files. These files allow you to specify the elements you're interested in tracking across different
versions of an application.

### Signature File JSON Schema

To help you create a signature file `sigmatcher` provides a JSON schema that you can use to validate your signature, and
get autocompletion and intellisense from your IDE.
You can get it by running the following command:

```shell
sigmatcher schema > definitions.schema.json
```

To use the schema in your IDE, you can add the following comment to the top of your signature file:

```yaml
# $schema: ./definitions.schema.json
```

### Structure of a Signature File

A signature file consists of a list of definitions, where each definition represents a class, method, or field you want
to match. Each definition can include one or more signatures, which are patterns `sigmatcher` will use to find matches
in the smali code.

Here's a basic example of what a signature file looks like:

```yaml
# $schema: ./definitions.schema.json
- name: "ConnectionManager"
  package: "com.example.package.network"
  signatures:
    - signature: 'ConnectionManager/openConnection: could not open connection due to a DNS error'
      type: regex
      count: 1
  methods:
    - name: "read"
      signatures:
        - signature: 'const-string v\d+, "Failed to read data from the server"'
          type: regex
          count: 1
          version_range: ">=1.0.0, <1.3.7"
        - signature: 'const-string v\d+, "Failed to read data because of a network error"'
          type: regex
          count: 1
          version_range: ">=1.3.7"
  fields:
    - name: "socket"
      signatures:
        - signature: '^\.field private final (?P<match>.+:Ljava/net/Socket;)'
          type: regex
          count: 1
```

#### Key Components

- name: The name of the class, method, or field.
- methods: A list of method definitions within a class. Follows a similar structure to the class definition.
- fields: A list of field definitions within a class. Follows a similar structure to the class definition.
- exports: A list of export definitions within a class. Exports can be any string in the code. They are mainly used in
  combination with macros to create more complex signatures.
- signatures: A list of signatures for the class, method, or field. Each signature includes:
  - type: The type of signature (for now only `regex` and `glob`).
  - signature: The pattern to match, depending on the signature type.
      For classes and methods they just need to match anywhere within the class/method. For fields and exports, they
      need to match the full field expression/export string, i.e. using the `match` capture group for regex signatures.
  - count: The number of times the signature should appear to be considered a match.
  - version_range: Optional. Specifies the application versions this signature applies to, using version specifiers
      like those used by pip and described in
      [PEP-440](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#version-specifiers).
      This could also contains a list of specifers, which act like a the logical "or" operator.

Most of those fields are optional, and you can use them as needed.
