    """
    Aggregate anomaly scores using the specified aggregation method.

    This function applies the chosen aggregation method to a set of anomaly scores.
    It supports various methods such as mean, median, minimum, and maximum.

    Args:
        method (Aggregation): The aggregation method to use. Must be one of the
                               methods defined in the Aggregation enum (e.g., MEAN, MEDIAN, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM).
        scores (np.array): A 2D NumPy array where each row represents an individual model's anomaly scores.

    Returns:
        list[float]: The aggregated anomaly scores as a list.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the provided aggregation method is not supported.
