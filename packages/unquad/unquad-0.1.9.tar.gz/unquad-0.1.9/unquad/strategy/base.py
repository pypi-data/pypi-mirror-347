    """
    Abstract base class for calibration strategies in anomaly detection.

    This class serves as the base for all calibration strategies used in anomaly detection.
    It provides a framework for fitting and calibrating detectors with specific strategies,
    while allowing customization through subclasses.

    Attributes:
        _plus (bool): A flag to indicate whether a specific adjustment (e.g., adding a constant)
                     should be applied during calibration. Default is False.

    Methods:
        __init__(plus=False):
            Initializes the base strategy with an optional flag to enable specific adjustments during calibration.

        fit_calibrate(x, detector, seed):
            Abstract method for fitting and calibrating the detector. This must be implemented by subclasses.

            Args:
                x (Union[pd.DataFrame, np.ndarray]): The data used for calibration.
                detector (BaseDetector): The anomaly detection model to be calibrated.
                seed (Optional[int]): Optional random seed for reproducibility.

            Raises:
                NotImplementedError: This method must be implemented by subclasses.
