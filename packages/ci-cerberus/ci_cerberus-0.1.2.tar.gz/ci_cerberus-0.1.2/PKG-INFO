### Environment Setup

#### Pre-Commit Hooks
This project makes use of pre-commit hooks in order to maintain a consistent codebase regardless of personal opinion or preferred coding style.

To do this, the following tools are run in a pre-commit hook:
1. Black
2. ISort
3. flake8

To set up the development environment:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
```
