# Code of Conduct

## Be Nice, Stay On Topic

This project has a simple code of conduct:

1. **Be respectful** and constructive in all interactions
2. Keep discussions on-topic and focused on the project
3. The project maintainer has final say on all project decisions and can remove disruptive participants if necessary

That's it. Let's build good software together.
