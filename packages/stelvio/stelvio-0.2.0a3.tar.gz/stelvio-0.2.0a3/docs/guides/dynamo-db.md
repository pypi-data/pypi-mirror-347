# Working with DynamoDB in Stelvio

This guide explains how to create and manage DynamoDB tables with Stelvio. Currently
support is limited and all you can do is to create table and define partition and sort
keys.

## Creating a DynamoDB table

Creating a DynamoDB table in Stelvio is straightforward.

```python
from stelvio.aws.dynamo_db import AttributeType, DynamoTable

todos_dynamo = DynamoTable(
    name="orders",
    fields={
        "customer_id": AttributeType.STRING,
        "order_date": AttributeType.STRING,
    },
    partition_key="customer_id",
    sort_key='order_date'
)
```

That's it!




## Indexes

Support for indexes is coming soon. 

TBD
