### foyndation

<a id="foyndation.initlogging"></a>

###### initlogging

```python
def initlogging()
```

Initialise the logging module to send debug (and higher levels) to stderr.

<a id="foyndation.innerclass"></a>

###### innerclass

```python
def innerclass(cls)
```

An instance of the decorated class may access its enclosing instance via `self`.

<a id="foyndation.invokeall"></a>

###### invokeall

```python
def invokeall(callables)
```

Invoke every callable, even if one or more of them fail. This is mostly useful for synchronising with futures.
If all succeeded return their return values as a list, otherwise raise all exceptions thrown as a chain.

<a id="foyndation.rmsuffix"></a>

###### rmsuffix

```python
def rmsuffix(text, suffix)
```

Return text with suffix removed, or `None` if text does not end with suffix.

<a id="foyndation.singleton"></a>

###### singleton

```python
def singleton(t)
```

The decorated class is replaced with a no-arg instance.
Can also be used to replace a factory function with its result.

<a id="foyndation.solo"></a>

###### solo

```python
def solo(v)
```

Assert exactly one object in the given sequence and return it.
