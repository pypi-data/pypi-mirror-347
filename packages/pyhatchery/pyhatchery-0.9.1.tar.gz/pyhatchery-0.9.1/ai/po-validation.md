  * `[ ] Dependency conflicts or special requirements are noted`
    * **NOT EVIDENT:** No specific conflicts noted. This is an ongoing concern in any project.

---

#### **2. INFRASTRUCTURE & DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCING (for PyHatchery itself)**

*(Generally N/A for a CLI tool like PyHatchery itself, but relevant for the *generated project's* capabilities regarding CI/CD, and for PyHatchery's own CI/CD)*

* **2.1 Database & Data Store Setup**
  * **N/A:** PyHatchery does not use a database.
* **2.2 API & Service Configuration**
  * **N/A:** PyHatchery is a CLI tool. It consumes the PyPI API.
* **2.3 Deployment Pipeline (for PyHatchery itself)**
  * `[X] CI/CD pipeline is established before any deployment actions`
    * **PASS:** `project-structure.md` shows `.github/workflows/tests.yml` and `publish.yml`. Epic 4 details these for *generated projects*, implying PyHatchery itself has or will have similar robust CI/CD for its own development and publishing (as per PRD: "PyHatchery Distribution: `pip install pyhatchery` (via PyPI)").
  * `[ ] Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is set up before use`
    * **N/A.**
  * `[X] Environment configurations (dev, staging, prod) are defined early`
    * **PASS (for CI/CD):** `environment-vars.md` lists `PYPI_API_TOKEN`, `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN` for PyHatchery's publishing.
  * `[X] Deployment strategies are defined before implementation`
    * **PASS:** Publishing to PyPI is the strategy for PyHatchery. Generated projects also have this strategy (Epic 4).
  * `[ ] Rollback procedures or considerations are addressed`
    * **NOT EVIDENT (but standard for PyPI):** Standard PyPI versioning (publishing new versions, users can pin to older versions) is the implicit rollback.

* **2.4 Testing Infrastructure (for PyHatchery itself)**
  * `[X] Testing frameworks are installed before writing tests`
    * **PASS:** `testing-strategy.md` mentions `pytest`, `pytest-mock`. PRD "Local Development & Testing Requirements" implies these are dev dependencies for PyHatchery.
  * `[X] Test environment setup precedes test implementation`
    * **PASS (Implicit):** `uv` environment setup for PyHatchery dev.
  * `[X] Mock services or data are defined before testing`
    * **PASS:** `testing-strategy.md` states "External dependencies... will be mocked." This applies to PyPI API calls (Story 1.1A).
  * `[X] Test utilities or helpers are created before use`
    * **PASS (Implicit):** `conftest.py` is listed in `project-structure.md`, suggesting shared fixtures.

---

#### **3. EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES & INTEGRATIONS (for PyHatchery itself)**

* **3.1 Third-Party Services**
  * `[X] Account creation steps are identified for required services`
    * **PASS (Implicit):** For PyPI publishing (PyHatchery & generated projects), accounts on PyPI/TestPyPI are needed. For GitHub Actions, a GitHub account. These are standard developer prerequisites.
  * `[X] API key acquisition processes are defined`
    * **PASS:** Story 4.3 (for generated projects) details PyPI/TestPyPI token generation. `environment-vars.md` lists `PYPI_API_TOKEN` and `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN` as secrets for PyHatchery's own CI/CD.
  * `[X] Steps for securely storing credentials are included`
    * **PASS:** Use of GitHub secrets is specified (`environment-vars.md`, Story 4.3 for generated projects).
  * `[X] Fallback or offline development options are considered`
    * **PASS:** PRD NFRs: "PyPI name check should gracefully handle network errors or API unavailability, informing the user and allowing them to proceed." Story 1.1A AC5 covers this.

* **3.2 External APIs**
  * `[X] Integration points with external APIs are clearly identified`
    * **PASS:** `api-reference.md` details PyPI API usage for project name validation (Story 1.1A).
  * `[ ] Authentication with external services is properly sequenced`
    * **N/A (for PyPI read):** No auth for the read-only check. For publishing, tokens are used (GitHub Actions for PyHatchery & generated projects).
  * `[X] API limits or constraints are acknowledged`
    * **PASS:** `api-reference.md` mentions rate limits for PyPI. Story 1.1A mentions graceful handling.
  * `[X] Backup strategies for API failures are considered`
    * **PASS:** As per PRD NFR and Story 1.1A, PyPI check failure is non-blocking.

* **3.3 Infrastructure Services**
  * **N/A:** PyHatchery doesn't directly provision cloud resources.

---

#### **4. USER/AGENT RESPONSIBILITY DELINEATION**

* **4.1 User Actions**

    * **PASS:** User provides project details (Epic 1), sets up GitHub secrets for publishing their generated project (Story 4.3).
  * `[X] Account creation on external services is properly assigned to users`
    * **PASS:** Implicitly, user needs GitHub/PyPI accounts for their own projects.
  * `[ ] Purchasing or payment actions are correctly assigned to users`
    * **N/A.**
  * `[X] Credential provision is appropriately assigned to users`
    * **PASS:** User needs to generate and add PyPI tokens as GitHub secrets for their generated project (Story 4.3).

* **4.2 Developer Agent Actions**
  * `[X] All code-related tasks are assigned to developer agents`
    * **PASS:** The epics and stories define code generation tasks for PyHatchery's functionality.
  * `[X] Automated processes are correctly identified as agent responsibilities`
    * **PASS:** Project scaffolding, file generation, CI/CD setup within generated projects.

  * `[X] Testing and validation are assigned to appropriate agents`
    * **PASS:** PyHatchery's own testing is covered by `testing-strategy.md`. Generated projects include test setup (Epic 2, Story 2.7) and CI tests (Epic 4).

---

#### **5. FEATURE SEQUENCING & DEPENDENCIES**

* **5.1 Functional Dependencies**
  * `[X] Features that depend on other features are sequenced correctly`
    * **PASS:**
      * Epic 1 (CLI, Name Input/Validation, Basic Structure, Output Dir) is foundational.
      * Epic 2 (File Templating/Personalization like `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, tool configs) depends on project name, author details, etc., from Epic 1. Story 2.8 (Slugification) is key and seems well-placed within Epic 2, assuming it utilizes services defined or conceptualized in Epic 1 for name handling.
      * Epic 3 (Dev Tooling Integration - Hatch scripts, listing deps) depends on files created in Epic 2 (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `.ruff.toml`).
      * Epic 4 (CI/CD Automation) depends on project structure, files, and Hatch scripts from Epics 1, 2, and 3.
  * `[X] Shared components are built before their use`
    * **PASS (Implicit):**
      * CLI handler (Story 1.1) -> Interactive Wizard / Non-interactive flags (Story 1.2, 1.3).
      * Name Service (conceptual, for Story 1.1A validation and Story 2.8 slugification) is used by subsequent file/content generation.
      * Context Builder (conceptual, using inputs from Stories 1.1-1.3) provides data for Epic 2 templating.
  * `[X] User flows follow a logical progression`
    * **PASS:** `pyhatchery new <name>` -> (Validation 1.1A) -> Wizard/Flags (1.2/1.3) -> Dir Creation (1.4) -> File Gen (Epic 2) -> Tooling Setup (Epic 3) -> CI/CD Gen (Epic 4) -> Git instructions (1.6). This is logical.
  * `[ ] Authentication features precede protected routes/features`
    * **N/A.**

* **5.2 Technical Dependencies**
  * `[X] Lower-level services are built before higher-level ones`
    * **PASS:** Basic CLI (1.1) before interactive data gathering (1.2). Structure creation (1.4) before file population (Epic 2).
  * `[X] Libraries and utilities are created before their use`
    * **PASS (Implicit):** Slugification logic (Story 2.8) would be a utility for template rendering. HTTP client for PyPI check (Story 1.1A).
  * `[X] Data models are defined before operations on them`
    * **PASS:** `data-models.md` defines `project_context`. Epic 1 gathers inputs to populate this context, which is then used by Epic 2 for templating.
  * `[ ] API endpoints are defined before client consumption`
    * **N/A.**

* **5.3 Cross-Epic Dependencies**
  * `[X] Later epics build upon functionality from earlier epics`
    * **PASS:**
      * Epic 2 (Templating) needs project name/slugs, author details from Epic 1.
      * Epic 3 (Tooling) needs project structure and `pyproject.toml` base from Epics 1 & 2.
      * Epic 4 (CI/CD) needs the project structure and scripts from Epics 1, 2, & 3.
  * `[X] No epic requires functionality from later epics`
    * **PASS:** The epics (1, 2, 3, 4) follow a logical build-up progression.
  * `[X] Infrastructure established in early epics is utilized consistently`
    * **PASS:** Core project structure and context from Epic 1 are used throughout. Slugs from Story 2.8 (Epic 2, though conceptually linked to Epic 1's name handling) are used in Epic 3 and 4.
  * `[X] Incremental value delivery is maintained`
    * **PASS:** Each epic delivers a significant, testable increment of functionality.

---

#### **6. MVP SCOPE ALIGNMENT**

* **6.1 PRD Goals Alignment**
  * `[X] All core goals defined in the PRD are addressed in epics/stories`
    * **PASS:**
      * PRD Goal 1 (functional CLI tool, project generation): Covered by Epic 1 (CLI, structure), Epic 2 (files), Epic 3 (tools), Epic 4 (CI/CD).
      * PRD Goal 2 (interactive/non-interactive, PyPI/PEP8 checks): Covered by Epic 1 (Stories 1.1, 1.1A, 1.2, 1.3).
      * PRD Goal 3 (personalization): Covered by Epic 2.
      * PRD Goal 4 (dev tools, structure): Covered by Epic 1 (structure), Epic 2 (tool config files), Epic 3 (tool integration in pyproject, scripts).

      * Specific FRs seem covered: FR1 (Epic 1.2), FR1A (Epic 1.1A), FR2 (Epic 1.3), FR3 (Epic 1.5), FR4 (Epic 1.4), FR5 (Epics 2 & 3), FR6 (Epic 2), FR7 (Epic 4), FR8 (Epic 1.6).
  * `[X] Features directly support the defined MVP goals`
    * **PASS:** All epics and stories directly map to MVP goals and functional requirements.
  * `[X] No extraneous features beyond MVP scope are included`
    * **PASS:** Features seem tightly aligned with PRD MVP scope. Post-MVP items are listed separately in PRD.
  * `[X] Critical features are prioritized appropriately`
    * **PASS:** Epic 1 is foundational and correctly prioritized. Subsequent epics build logically.

* **6.2 User Journey Completeness**
  * `[X] All critical user journeys are fully implemented`
    * **PASS:** Main user journey (creating a project interactively/non-interactively, getting a ready-to-use structure with tools and CI/CD) is covered by Epics 1-4.
  * `[X] Edge cases and error scenarios are addressed`
    * **PASS:**
      * Story 1.1A: PyPI/PEP8 warnings, graceful network error handling for PyPI check.
      * Story 1.5: Handling existing output directory.
      * Story 1.1: Invalid/missing project name.
      * Story 1.3: Missing params in non-interactive mode.
      * PRD NFRs on error handling. `coding-standards.md` includes error handling strategy.
  * `[X] User experience considerations are included`
    * **PASS:** PRD UX Goals are defined.
      * Epic 1: Interactive wizard (1.2), clear CLI (1.1), non-blocking warnings (1.1A), feedback messages (PRD: "Other Technical Considerations").
      * Epic 2: Personalized README (2.3) with usage.
      * Epic 4: Clear docs for enabling publishing (4.3).
  * `[ ] Accessibility requirements are incorporated if specified`
    * **N/A (Not specified for CLI beyond standard practices):** Standard CLI accessibility is assumed.

* **6.3 Technical Requirements Satisfaction**
  * `[X] All technical constraints from the PRD are addressed`
    * **PASS:**
      * Python `>=3.11` for PyHatchery. Target Python for generated project (Story 1.2, 2.1).
      * `jinja2`, `python-dotenv`, `requests` (PRD, Story 1.1A).
      * No Cookiecutter (PRD). Direct Jinja2 templating (Epic 2).
      * Tool versions (PRD, Story 2.1 for dev deps).
      * Personalization/slugification (Story 2.8).
      * Maintainable templates (Epic 2 structure).
      * Config structure (`pyproject.toml` for core, separate files for ruff/pylint - Epic 2).
  * `[X] Non-functional requirements are incorporated`
    * **PASS:** Addressed throughout:
      * Performance (PRD NFRs; PyPI check timeout Story 1.1A).
      * Reliability (PRD NFRs; graceful PyPI error handling Story 1.1A).
      * Security (PRD NFRs; HTTPS for PyPI, secrets guidance Story 4.3).
      * Maintainability (PRD NFRs; `coding-standards.md`, modular epics).
      * Usability (PRD NFRs; Epic 1 CLI/wizard, Epic 2 README, Epic 4 docs).
  * `[X] Architecture decisions align with specified constraints`
    * **PASS:** Modular monolith for CLI, Jinja2 templating, layered config (Epic 1.3), component design (implicit in story breakdown per component, e.g., `name_service.py` for Story 1.1A/2.8), PyPI API wrapper (Story 1.1A, `http_client.py` in `project-structure.md`). This aligns with PRD "Initial Architect Prompt."
  * `[X] Performance considerations are appropriately addressed`
    * **PASS:** PRD NFRs mention generation time and PyPI check timeout (Story 1.1A AC5 ensures this doesn't block if slow/fails).

---

#### **7. RISK MANAGEMENT & PRACTICALITY**

* **7.1 Technical Risk Mitigation**
  * `[X] Complex or unfamiliar technologies have appropriate learning/prototyping stories`
    * **PASS:** Technologies (Python stdlib, Jinja2, argparse, requests, common dev tools) are standard. No high-risk new tech.
  * `[X] High-risk components have explicit validation steps`
    * **PASS:** Project name validation/slugification (Story 1.1A, 2.8) is detailed. PyPI interaction (Story 1.1A) has error handling. Templating is complex but Jinja2 is mature.
  * `[X] Fallback strategies exist for risky integrations`
    * **PASS:** PyPI check failure is non-blocking (Story 1.1A).
  * `[ ] Performance concerns have explicit testing/validation`
    * **PARTIAL PASS:** PRD mentions target generation time. `testing-strategy.md` doesn't explicitly call out performance tests but notes informal monitoring. E2E tests (part of integration tests in `testing-strategy.md`) would cover overall generation time. Formal performance tests are not defined but may not be critical for MVP if informal checks are good.

* **7.2 External Dependency Risks**
  * `[X] Risks with third-party services are acknowledged and mitigated`
    * **PASS:** PyPI API unavailability handled (Story 1.1A).
  * `[X] API limits or constraints are addressed`
    * **PASS:** PyPI rate limits mentioned in `api-reference.md`, and graceful handling implied in Story 1.1A.
  * `[X] Backup strategies exist for critical external services`
    * **PASS:** Non-blocking for PyPI check.
  * `[ ] Cost implications of external services are considered`
    * **N/A:** PyPI is free. GitHub Actions have free tiers adequate for this scope.

* **7.3 Timeline Practicality**
  * `[X] Story complexity and sequencing suggest a realistic timeline`
    * **PASS:** Stories are well-defined and broken down. Complexity per story seems manageable. Sequence is logical.
  * `[X] Dependencies on external factors are minimized or managed`
    * **PASS:** PyPI check is the main one, managed.
  * `[X] Parallel work is enabled where possible`
    * **PASS:** Once Epic 1's core context/structure is defined, work on different aspects of Epic 2 (various file templates), Epic 3 (different tool integrations), and Epic 4 (different workflow files) could potentially be parallelized if multiple developer agents were involved.
  * `[X] Critical path is identified and optimized`
    * **PASS:** Epic 1 -> Epic 2 -> Epic 3 -> Epic 4 is the logical critical path.

---

#### **8. DOCUMENTATION & HANDOFF**

* **8.1 Developer Documentation (for PyHatchery itself)**
  * `[X] API documentation is created alongside implementation`
    * **PASS:** `api-reference.md` for consumed PyPI API. No exposed API for PyHatchery.
  * `[X] Setup instructions are comprehensive`
    * **PASS (Implicit):** PyHatchery's `README.md` (from `project-structure.md`) and `pyproject.toml` would guide dev setup. Generated projects have README with setup (Story 2.3, 3.1, 4.3).
  * `[X] Architecture decisions are documented`
    * **PASS:** PRD's "Initial Architect Prompt", `project-structure.md`, `coding-standards.md`, `data-models.md` cover aspects. An explicit `architecture.md` is listed in `project-structure.md` which should consolidate this. (Assuming `architecture.md` will be sufficiently detailed based on provided design documents).
  * `[X] Patterns and conventions are documented`
    * **PASS:** `coding-standards.md` is thorough.

* **8.2 User Documentation (for PyHatchery CLI users)**
  * `[X] User guides or help documentation is included if required`
    * **PASS:**
      * PyHatchery's own CLI help (implicit via `argparse` in Story 1.1).
      * Generated `README.md` (Story 2.3, 4.3) serves as user guide for the *generated project*.
      * Git init instructions (Story 1.6).
  * `[X] Error messages and user feedback are considered`
    * **PASS:** PRD emphasizes clear messages (NFRs, UX). Stories like 1.1A, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5 specify error/warning messages. `coding-standards.md` covers error handling strategy.
  * `[X] Onboarding flows are fully specified`
    * **PASS:** Epic 1 (CLI wizard, non-interactive mode) is the onboarding flow for using PyHatchery.
  * `[ ] Support processes are defined if applicable`
    * **N/A (for MVP):** Likely GitHub issues for an open-source tool like PyHatchery. Not explicitly documented but standard.

---

#### **9. POST-MVP CONSIDERATIONS**

* **9.1 Future Enhancements**
  * `[X] Clear separation between MVP and future features`
    * **PASS:** PRD lists "Post-MVP / Future Enhancements" clearly.
  * `[X] Architecture supports planned future enhancements`
    * **PASS:** Modular component-based design and Jinja2 templating (Epics 1 & 2) should allow for new template variations, tool choices, or plugins as suggested in PRD Post-MVP.
  * `[ ] Technical debt considerations are documented`
    * **NOT EVIDENT:** Not explicitly documented, but strong coding standards (`coding-standards.md`) and comprehensive testing (`testing-strategy.md`) aim to minimize it.
  * `[X] Extensibility points are identified`
    * **PASS (Implicit):** PRD mentions "Plugin system" as future. Current architecture (component-based, template-driven) provides a basis for future extensibility.

* **9.2 Feedback Mechanisms**
  * `[ ] Analytics or usage tracking is included if required`
    * **N/A (for MVP):** Not specified in PRD for MVP.
  * `[ ] User feedback collection is considered`
    * **N/A (for MVP):** Not specified in PRD, usually via GitHub for such tools.
  * `[ ] Monitoring and alerting are addressed`
    * **N/A (for CLI tool).**
  * `[X] Performance measurement is incorporated`
    * **PARTIAL PASS:** PRD KPI "Time-to-Project-Ready." `testing-strategy.md` notes informal monitoring rather than formal performance tests. Sufficient for MVP.

---

#### **Specific Checks for Common Issues (Re-evaluation):**

* `[X] Verify Epic 1 includes all necessary project setup steps`
  * **PASS:** Epic 1 now covers CLI, name input/validation, interactive/non-interactive modes, output location, basic directory structure, and Git guidance.
* `[ ] Confirm infrastructure is established before being used`
  * **N/A (for CLI tool itself).** For generated projects, the project structure (Epic 1) is established before files (Epic 2), tools (Epic 3), and CI/CD (Epic 4) are layered on, which is correct.
* `[X] Check deployment pipelines are created before deployment actions`
  * **PASS:** For generated projects, Epic 4 defines GitHub Actions workflows including publishing. PyHatchery itself is assumed to have similar.
* `[X] Ensure user actions are limited to what requires human intervention`
  * **PASS:** User provides inputs and API keys/secrets.
* `[X] Verify external dependencies are properly accounted for`
  * **PASS:** PyPI API for name check is documented and handled.
* `[X] Confirm logical progression from infrastructure to features`
  * **PASS:** Epic 1 (Core CLI & Structure) -> Epic 2 (File Templating) -> Epic 3 (Tooling Config) -> Epic 4 (CI/CD Automation). This is a logical progression.

## 3. Real-World Implementation Wisdom Application

* **New Technologies/Learning:** The tech stack is standard Python. No PoC stories seem necessary.
* **Risk Mitigation for Complexity:**
  * Slugification (Story 2.8) and PyPI/PEP8 name validation (Story 1.1A) are key complex areas that are explicitly addressed.
  * Templating logic is inherently complex but uses the mature `jinja2` library. The breakdown into many small, focused template files (implied by Epic 2 stories for each config file) helps manage this.
* **External Dependency Blockers:** PyPI API is the only runtime external dependency for a core feature (name validation), and its failure is handled gracefully (non-blocking warning as per Story 1.1A).
* **Core Infrastructure First:** Epic 1 now correctly establishes the core CLI, input mechanisms, and basic project structure before other features are built upon it. This is a significant improvement.

#### **Critical Deficiencies:**

* None identified. The inclusion of `epic_01.md` has resolved the previous critical blockers.

#### **Recommendations:**

1. **Formalize `architecture.md`:** While information is distributed, ensure the central `docs/architecture.md` (mentioned in `project-structure.md`) clearly consolidates the architectural vision, component responsibilities (e.g., `ProjectNameService`, `ContextBuilder`, `TemplateProcessor`, `CLIHandler`, `InteractiveWizard`, `ConfigLoader`, `HTTPClient`, `ProjectGenerator` as per `project-structure.md`), and their interactions. This will be crucial for the development agent(s).
2. **Slugification Logic (Story 2.8):** This story is in Epic 2 but is fundamentally tied to name processing from Epic 1 (Story 1.1A). Ensure the `ProjectNameService` (conceptualized from `project-structure.md`) handles all aspects of name validation (Story 1.1A) and slug generation (Story 2.8) cohesively. The `project_context` (from `data-models.md`) should be populated with all necessary name variations by this service early in the process.
3. **Clarify `python_package_slug` vs. `project_name_slug`:**
    * Epic 1 Story 1.4 uses `project_name_slug` for `src/<project_name_slug>/`.
    * Epic 2 Story 2.1 uses `python_package_slug` for `src/<python_package_slug>/__about__.py`.
    * `data-models.md` lists `project_slug_python`.
    * Consolidate terminology. "Python package slug" or `project_slug_python` seems most descriptive for the PEP8-compliant, underscore-separated version used for the actual Python package directory and import name. "PyPI project slug" or `project_slug_pypi` is good for the hyphenated version. Ensure these are consistently used and clearly defined as inputs to the templating context. Story 2.8 should be the definitive source for this logic.
4. **Python Version for `.ruff.toml`:** Story 2.5 specifies `target-version = "py<python_version_short>" # e.g., "py310"`. Ensure the logic for `python_version_short` (from `data-models.md`) correctly transforms the user's Python preference (e.g., "3.10", "3.11") into this short form (e.g., "310", "311").

#### **Final Decision:**

* **APPROVED**: The plan, with the inclusion of `epic_01.md` and all supporting documentation, is comprehensive, properly sequenced, and ready for implementation. The recommendations above are minor clarifications or points of emphasis rather than blockers.

**PO Mode Summary of Findings:**

* **Overall Plan:** Comprehensive and well-structured.
* **Epic Sequencing:** Epics 1 through 4 present a logical flow from core CLI functionality and project setup, through file templating and personalization, development tool integration, and finally CI/CD automation. This sequence ensures foundational elements are in place before dependent features are built.
* **Requirement Coverage:** All functional and non-functional requirements, as well as user experience goals outlined in the `prd.md`, appear to be adequately covered by the stories within the four epics.
* **Technical Soundness:** The technical approach (Python, Jinja2, standard CLI practices, modular components) is sound and aligns with the PRD's technical constraints and architectural guidance.
* **Risk Management:** Potential risks, such as PyPI name conflicts or network issues during validation, are acknowledged and have mitigation strategies (e.g., non-blocking warnings, graceful error handling).
* **Documentation:** The provided documents (`prd.md`, all epic files, `project-structure.md`, `coding-standards.md`, `testing-strategy.md`, `data-models.md`, `api-reference.md`, `environment-vars.md`) create a robust ecosystem for development.

**Minor Recommendations (Reiterated from Detailed Checklist):**

1. **`architecture.md` Consolidation:** Ensure `docs/architecture.md` clearly centralizes the architectural vision and component interactions.
2. **`ProjectNameService` Cohesion:** Confirm that the conceptual `ProjectNameService` handles all name validation (Story 1.1A) and slug generation (Story 2.8) logically, populating the `project_context` with all necessary name variations early.
3. **Slug Terminology Consistency:** Standardize on `project_slug_python` (for underscore version) and `project_slug_pypi` (for hyphenated version) within the `project_context` and ensure these are consistently applied.
4. **`python_version_short` Logic:** Ensure the transformation from user's Python preference (e.g., "3.10") to the short form for tool configs (e.g., "310" for Ruff's `target-version`) is clearly defined and implemented.
