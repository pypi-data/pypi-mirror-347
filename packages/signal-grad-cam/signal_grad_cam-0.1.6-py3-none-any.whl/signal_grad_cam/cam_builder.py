        Initializes the CamBuilder class. The constructor also displays, if present and retrievable, the 1D- and
        2D-convolutional layers in the network, as well as the final Sigmoid/Softmax activation. Additionally, the CAM
        algorithms available for generating the explanations are shown.

        :param model: (mandatory) A torch.nn.Module, tf.keras.Model, or any object (with PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras
            layers among its attributes) representing a convolutional neural network model to be explained.
            Unconventional models should always be set to inference mode before being provided as inputs.
        :param transform_fn: (optional, default is None) A callable function to preprocess np.ndarray data before model
            evaluation. This function is also expected to convert data into either PyTorch or TensorFlow tensors. The
            function may optionally take as a second input a list of objects required by the preprocessing method.
        :param class_names: (optional, default is None) A list of strings where each string represents the name of an
            output class.
        :param time_axs: (optional, default is 1) An integer index indicating whether the input signal's time axis is
            represented as the first or second dimension of the input array.
        :param input_transposed: (optional, default is False) A boolean indicating whether the input array is transposed
            during model inference, either by the model itself or by the preprocessing function.
        :param ignore_channel_dim: (optional, default is False) A boolean indicating whether to ignore the channel
            dimension. This is useful when the model expects inputs without a singleton channel dimension.
        :param is_regression_network: (optional, default is False) A boolean indicating whether the network is designed
            for a regression task. If set to True, the CAM will highlight both positive and negative contributions.
            While negative contributions are typically irrelevant for classification-based saliency maps, they can be
            meaningful in regression settings, as they may represent features that decrease the predicted value.
        :param model_output_index: (optional, default is None) An integer index specifying which of the model's outputs
            represents output scores (or probabilities). If there is only one output, this argument can be ignored.
        :param extend_search: (optional, default is False) A boolean flag indicating whether to deepend the search for
            candidate layers. It should be set true if no convolutional layer was found.
        :param padding_dim: (optional, default is None) An integer specifying the maximum length along the time axis to
            which each item will be padded for batching.
        :param seed: (optional, default is 11) An integer seed for random number generators, used to ensure
            reproducibility during model evaluation.
