Overview
========

*bisos.myLinkedIn* takes contents of
Basic\ :sub:`LinkedInDataExport`.zip and converts them to Vcards for
your connections and then augments them.

bisos.myLinkedIn is a python package that uses the
`PyCS-Framework <https://github.com/bisos-pip/pycs>`__ for adoption and
adaptation of **linkedinVcard** to python and PyCS-Framework. It is a
BISOS-Capability and a Standalone-BISOS-Package.

The \`bisos.linkedin\` package automates the process of transforming
LinkedIn export data into enriched vCards, specifically focusing on the
first-level connections present in your LinkedIn data. LinkedIn’s export
includes valuable information about your connections—such as names, job
titles, company details, invitations, and messages—that naturally fits
into a contact management system like vCards. By leveraging this
package, you can convert, enrich, and augment these details into vCards
that are readily importable into your preferred usage environment (e.g.,
Emacs bbdb, MS Outlook, or any other vCard-compatible system). This
process is repeatable and scalable, making it easier to maintain an
up-to-date contact database, effectively integrating LinkedIn connection
data into your daily workflow.

The \`bisos.linkedin\` Python package is a set of utilities designed to
transform and enrich LinkedIn export data into vCards for your
first-level connections. The package automates the process of creating
and augmenting vCards from the exported LinkedIn data (such as
Connections.csv, Invitations.csv, and messages.csv) by adding local,
remote, and external information.

This package enables the creation of rich vCards that contain contact
details like names, emails, job titles, and invitation history, based on
your LinkedIn export. The tool can also enhance the vCards by extracting
additional information from LinkedIn contact pages and external contact
enrichment sources.

A Standalone Command-Services PyCS Facility of BISOS
====================================================

Layered on top of Debian, **BISOS**: (By\* Internet Services Operating
System) is a unified and universal framework for developing both
internet services and software-service continuums that use internet
services. PyCS (Python Command-Services) of BISOS is a framework that
converges development of CLI and Services. See the `Nature of
Polyexistentials <https://github.com/bxplpc/120033>`__ book for
additional information.

bisos.myLinkedIn is a standalone piece of BISOS. It can be used as a
self-contained Python package separate from BISOS.

============

#. **Local Augmentation\***:

   -  Augments vCards with data from \`Connections.csv`,
      \`Invitations.csv`, and \`messages.csv`.
   -  For each contact, the invitation status is captured (whether you

      text is added to the vCard.

#. **Remote Augmentation**:

   -  Extracts additional details from LinkedIn's Contact Info page via
      automated scraping, such as email addresses, phone numbers, and
      other publicly available contact information.

#. **External Augmentation**:

   -  Optionally integrates with external services for contact
      enrichment to further enhance your vCards with data such as job
      titles, company names, and social profiles.

#. **Seamless vCard Generation**:

   -  The tool automatically converts your first-level LinkedIn
      connections into individual vCard files, using the unique LinkedIn
      ID as the file name.
   -  Output vCards are enriched and ready for import into other systems
      (e.g., CRM, contacts app).

#. **Command-Line Tools**:

   -  The package provides a set of command-line utilities that allow
      you to:

      -  Convert your LinkedIn export CSV files to vCards.
      -  Augment vCards with additional information.
      -  Extract contact details from LinkedIn profiles automatically.

bisos.linkedin Python Package
=============================

The \`bisos.linkedin\` Python package provides a set of utilities for
creating a set of vCards for your first-level LinkedIn connections based
on the **Basic\ LinkedInDataExport**. It uses local data from
**Connections.csv**, **Invitations.csv**, and **messages.csv** to create
rich representations of your LinkedIn network in vCard (.vcf) format.

Features
========

-  **Local Augmentation**: Enhances vCards by using the following CSV
   files:

   -  **Connections.csv**: The basic connection data, including LinkedIn
      ID, profile URL, name, etc.
   -  **Invitations.csv**: Captures whether you invited the connection
      or were invited, along with the invitation text.
   -  **messages.csv**: Adds LinkedIn message history between you and
      your connections, showing the conversation details and direction.

-  **Output Format**: Each vCard file represents a LinkedIn connection
   and includes the relevant data from the
   **Basic\ LinkedInDataExport**. These files are named based on the
   LinkedIn ID and are saved in the specified directory.

-  **CLI Tools**: The package includes command-line tools for the
   following tasks:

   -  **Create vCards from LinkedIn Data**: Process the CSV files and
      generate vCard files for all your first-level connections.
   -  **Augment vCards with Invitations**: Add information from
      **Invitations.csv** to the existing vCards, including who invited
      whom and the invitation message.
   -  **Augment vCards with Messages**: Add conversation details from
      **messages.csv**, organizing the messages in chronological order
      with sender information.

-  **Flexible Integration**: All tools can be run independently or
   combined into a full data augmentation pipeline.

Benefits
========

While there are related tools and services that extract and manipulate
LinkedIn data, your approach with bisos.linkedin provides a unique
solution by transforming LinkedIn export data into enriched vCards for
your first-level connections. This tool offers several unique features:

Full Integration with LinkedIn's Exported Data: The package works
directly with LinkedIn's exported data (CSV files and ZIP), converting
them into structured vCards.

vCard Augmentation from Multiple Sources: The tool enriches vCards by
adding information from local (LinkedIn exports), remote (scraped
contact data), and external sources (contact enrichment services).

Customization for LinkedIn Data: The tool is specifically designed for
LinkedIn data, allowing rich customization and transformation of
connection details into vCards.

Open-Source, Self-Hosted Solution: This package offers a self-hosted,
open-source solution that gives users complete control over their
LinkedIn data and privacy, without relying on third-party SaaS
platforms.

This holistic, self-contained solution for augmenting LinkedIn data with
multiple sources and outputting it in a standardized vCard format makes
your approach unique in the landscape of LinkedIn data tools.
