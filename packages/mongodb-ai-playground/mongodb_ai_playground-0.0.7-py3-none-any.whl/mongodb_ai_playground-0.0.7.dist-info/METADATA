# MongoDB AI Playground

MongoDB AI Playground is a set of interactive widgets to explore, test, and visualize MongoDB-powered AI capabilities, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG workflows, using modern LLM and vector search integrations.

---

## Overview

The **MongoDB AI Playground** provides interactive widgets for experimenting with advanced AI capabilities on MongoDB, including:

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Chunk, embed, store, and query documents using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search and LLMs.

Built as a set of [AnyWidget](https://anywidget.dev/) Jupyter widgets, this playground is designed for rapid prototyping, learning, and demonstration of GenAI + MongoDB workflows.

---

## Features

- üìÑ **Document Chunking**: Flexible strategies (fixed, recursive, markdown) for splitting documents.
- üß† **Embeddings & Vector Search**: Store and search embeddings in MongoDB Atlas using [langchain-mongodb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mongodb).
- üîé **RAG Playground UI**: Step-by-step interface for chunking, embedding, and querying.
- üï∏Ô∏è **Knowledge Graph RAG**: Build and visualize entity/relation graphs from docs and run graph-based QA.
- üß© **Extensible**: Built for experimentation with LangChain so that you can use different loaders, embeddings models, LLMs and more.

---

## Installation

3. Pre-requisites
- An [**Atlas account**](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register?tck=docs_atlas) with a cluster running **MongoDB version 6.0.11**, **7.0.2**, or later (including release candidates). Ensure your **IP address** is included in your Atlas project's [**access list**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/ip-access-list/#std-label-access-list). To learn more, see [**Create a Cluster**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/create-new-cluster/#std-label-create-new-cluster).
- An environment to run interactive Python notebooks such as JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab and VSCode. Make sure you have widget support enabled.
- Create a database and collection (:warning: if you choose to use an existing collection, usage with the playground will erase the collection's data. Providing a new collection is recommended)
-  [**Create an Atlas Vector Search index**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/indexes/create-vector-search-index/) with the correct dimension associated with the embedding model you will use. The field containing the embedding must be named **`embedding`**.

1. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install mongodb-ai-playground
```

The mongodb-ai-playground depends on the following Python libraries: `anywidget`, `ipywidgets`, `langchain`, `langchain-mongodb`, and `pymongo`.

## Usage

### RAG Playground

```python
from mongodb_ai_playground import MongoDBRAGPlayground

# Example: Pass your own loader, embedding model, LLM, and MongoDB collection
widget = MongoDBRAGPlayground(
    loader=...,              # LangChain loader
    embedding_model=...,     # LangChain embedding model 
    llm=...,                 # LangChain Chat Model (LLM) for answering questions (OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, etc.)
    mongo_collection=...,    # PyMongo collection for storing vectors
    index_name=...           # Name of your Atlas Vector Search index, you need to create if you don't have one, with the correct dimension (field containing the embedding is 'embedding')
)
widget # Display the playground widget
```

- All interactions are performed via the interactive UI in Jupyter-compatible environments.
- Visualize chunking, embeddings, vector search results, and knowledge graphs.
