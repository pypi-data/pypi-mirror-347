# Concall Parser

**Concall Parser** is an open-source Python library designed to efficiently extract insights from earnings call (concall) transcripts. It enables seamless extraction of management commentary, analyst discussions, company information, perfect for building financial research tools, summarizers, or investor dashboards.

Check out the repo at [Github](https://github.com/JS12540/concall-parser/).

---

**Note:** We currently support earnings calls of Indian companies (BSE, NSE registered) only.

## üì¶ Installation

Install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install concall-parser
```


## Usage

You can initialize the ConcallParser either with a local PDF path or directly via a URL to the concall document.

### Using a Local PDF

```python
from concall_parser.parser import ConcallParser

parser = ConcallParser(path="path/to/concall.pdf")
```

### Using a PDF Link

```python
from concall_parser.parser import ConcallParser

parser = ConcallParser(link="https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/458af4e6-8be5-4ce2-b4f1-119e53cd4c5a.pdf")
```

## Configuration

The library leverages GROQ for core NLP tasks such as intent classification. To use GROQ, ensure the following environment variables are set:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR GROQ API KEY"
export GROQ_MODEL="YOUR GROQ MODEL NAME"
```

Or just pass in the values when creating the parser object.

```python
parser = ConcallParser(path="path/to/concall.pdf", groq_api_key=your_api_key, groq_model=preferred_groq_model)
```


We use llama3-70b-8192 as the default model if any groq supported models are not provided as env.
