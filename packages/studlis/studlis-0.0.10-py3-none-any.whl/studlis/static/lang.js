lang_stats_desc[3] = "Perception dictates a character's awareness of their surroundings, improving their ability to detect subtle movements. Increases the accuracy of ranged attacks and the effectiveness of traps and other devices."
lang_stats_desc[4] = "Agility affects a character's speed and finesse, influencing their ability to dodge attacks, perform acrobatic maneuvers, and determine the order of actions in combat, often granting higher attack priority."

lang_resources_desc[0] = "Health Power signifies the character's vitality, denoting the capacity for self-healing, managing wounds, and mitigating blood loss over time. Low Health Power leads to a diminished ability for self-heal, resulting in failure to recover from severe wounds, which can lead to incapacitation and, ultimately, death."
lang_resources_desc[1] = "Mana represents the reservoir of magical energy available for casting spells and using abilities, replenishing with rest or specific items. Depleted Mana reserves limit the ability to perform magical actions, hindering spellcasting capabilities and potentially leaving the caster vulnerable in situations requiring magical intervention."
lang_resources_desc[2] = "Stamina measures the character's endurance for ongoing physical efforts, determining how long they can sustain activity before needing to recover. As Stamina depletes, the ability to maintain physical actions diminishes, leading to slower movements, decreased effectiveness in combat, and eventual inability to perform actions requiring physical exertion until adequately rested."
