â†©Fix reverse issue (#1193) (#1194)

# Description

Unfortunately it is possible to deploy invalid models to CDF with
reverse direct pointing direct relations that does not point in the
opposite way. This makes it impossible to read these models into CDF
(and fix them). Thus replacing the error with a warning in the
validation.

## Changelog
### Fixed

- Reading a data model from CDF with `neat.read.cdf.data_model(...)`
with a reverse direct relation that points to a direct relation that is
not pointing in the opposite direction now gives a warning instead of an
error.
