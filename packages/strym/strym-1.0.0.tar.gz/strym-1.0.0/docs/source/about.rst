Analysis of CAN Data from modern consumer vehicles, specifically consumer cars remain a challenge. As of now, there is no standard software, pipeline or workflow 
available that seamlessly integrates CAN Data analysis, driving characterization and visualization. comma.ai has already democratized the interfacing of personal
computers to consumer cars via custom made hardware devices such as Panda and Giraffe. At Compositional Systems Lab, we have build libpanda, a low-level C++ library to 
empower Panda and Giraffe devices to read CAN data in real-time.
