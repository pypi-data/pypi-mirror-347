    # As per https://www2.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~kreimer/wp-content/uploads/Foissy.pdf,
    # the coproduct can be written as a sum over admissible cuts, defined as cuts
    # where every walk from the root to a leaf contains at most one cut edge.

    # product of the forest of branches resulting from a cut and the remaining tree
    # connected to the root. Denote these by P_c(t) and R_c(t) respectively, for a
    # cut c.

    # and R_c(t) = [R_c(t_1), R_c(t_2), ..., R_c(t_k)]. This allows us to use the
