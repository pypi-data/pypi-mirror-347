"""
This module allows for the symbolic manipulation and evaluation of truncated
B-Series on unlabelled trees, for an ODE of the form

.. math::

    \\frac{dy}{ds} = f(y).

Given a weights function :math:`\\varphi`, the associated truncated B-Series is

.. math::

    B_h(\\varphi, y_0) := \\sum_{|t| \\leq n} \\frac{h^{|t|}}{\\sigma(t)} \\varphi(t) F(t)(y_0),

where the sum runs over all trees of order at most :math:`n`, :math:`\\sigma(t)` is the symmetry factor
of a tree, and :math:`F(t)(y_0)` are the elementary differentials, defined recursively on trees by:

.. math::

    F(\\emptyset) = y,
.. math::

    F(\\bullet) = f(y),
.. math::

    F([t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_k])(y) = f^{(k)}(y)(F(t_1)(y), F(t_2)(y), \\ldots, F(t_k)(y)).

The main objective of this module is to evaluate existing B-series. For more complicated operations,
it is recommended to work with the underlying character (or elementary weights function) and then
construct a B-series from the result. For example, take the following B-series corresponding to
the Euler and RK4 schemes:

.. code-block:: python

    import kauri as kr

    y1 = sp.symbols('y1')
    y = sp.Matrix([y1])
    f = sp.Matrix([y1 ** 2])

    bs1 = kr.BSeries(y, f, kr.euler.elementary_weights_map(), 5)
    bs2 = kr.BSeries(y, f, kr.rk4.elementary_weights_map(), 5)

At the level of the underlying characters, the composition of two B-series is given by the BCK product
of the characters, so one can get the composition by doing

.. code-block:: python

    bs_composition = kr.BSeries(y, f, bs2.weights * bs1.weights, 5)

Similarly the inverse B-series for the Euler scheme is given by

.. code-block:: python

    bs_inverse = kr.BSeries(y, f, bs1.weights ** (-1), 5)

and the symmetric-adjoint method is given by

.. code-block:: python

    bs_adjoint = kr.BSeries(y, f, bs1.weights ** (-1) & kr.sign, 5)

where `kr.sign` is the :class:`Map` sending `t` to `-t`.
