Adds prices to the export of products for Shopinvader.
One price is exported per pricelist set on the index.

It means that your website needs to know which pricelist to choose.
Thus, we suggest to use this module in combination with ``shopinvader_api_customer``,
which provides an API to get the customer's pricelist.
