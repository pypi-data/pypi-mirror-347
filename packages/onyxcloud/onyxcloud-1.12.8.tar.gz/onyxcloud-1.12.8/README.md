# CTF Challenge: OnyxCloud - NOMI's Signal Decryption

Welcome to the **OnyxCloud** CTF challenge! Your mission begins with an intriguing introduction from NOMI, the Neural Operations & Multilingual Interface. Prepare to decode cryptic signals and uncover the secrets hidden within the OnyxCloud fleet's transmissions.

## Introduction

Upon starting the challenge, you'll be greeted with the following message:

```
--------------------------------------------------
 Welcome aboard, Inspector!

 I am NOMI, your Neural Operations & Multilingual Interface
   here to bridge communication with the OnyxCloud fleet.

 Advisory: Subspace linguistic algorithms are in preliminary phases.
   Translations are severely hindered due to alien signal complexity!
--------------------------------------------------
```

### What Does This Mean?

NOMI is your AI guide, designed to assist in decoding alien transmissions. However, the system's **linguistic algorithms** are still experimental, making the translation process challenging. You'll need to apply your analytical skills to extract meaningful data from fragmented signals.

## Objective

Your goal is to:

- Analyze NOMI's output for clues hidden in the text.
- Identify patterns, ciphers, or encoded messages.
- Decipher the alien signals to reveal the next steps in the challenge.

## Hints

- Pay close attention to formatting, symbols, and color-coded text.
- NOMI's messages may contain encoded strings, hexadecimal data, or subtle clues in the dialogue.
- Be mindful of the "advisory" notice â€” garbled data may require multiple approaches to decode.


Good luck, Inspector!
