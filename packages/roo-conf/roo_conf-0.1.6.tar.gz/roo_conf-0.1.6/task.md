# Implementation Task List for roo-conf (Code-GH Subtask)

This file outlines the tasks completed in the Code-GH subtask.

## Tasks:

- Verify the `[project.scripts]` section in `pyproject.toml` is correct, containing only the `roo-conf` entry point pointing to a Python function. (Completed)
- Confirm the `publish.sh` script exists and is executable. (Completed)
- Test running `uvx roo-conf` to see if the `uvx` caching issue has resolved itself. (Completed - Still fails, likely due to persistent uvx cache)
- If `uvx roo-conf` works, confirm the package functionality (listing files). (Skipped - uvx failed)
- If `uvx roo-conf` still fails, note the error and acknowledge that manual `uv` cache clearing might be necessary (outside the scope of this subtask). (Completed - Noted persistent uvx cache issue)
- Test running `python -m roo_conf.deploy` to confirm the alternative execution method still works. (Completed - Failed initially due to environment, succeeded after reinstall and using uv run)
- Test running `./publish.sh` to confirm the publishing workflow works when executed directly. (Completed - Script runs, builds, clears cache, but fails on PyPI authentication)
- Update documentation (`README.md`, `task.md`) as needed based on testing results. (Completed)
- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for automated publishing. (Completed)
- Modified `publish.sh` to remove version incrementing. (Completed)

## Findings:

- The `[project.scripts]` in `pyproject.toml` is correctly configured.
- The `uvx roo-conf` command is likely failing due to a persistent cache of the old, invalid wheel within `uvx`.
- The `uv run roo-conf` command successfully executes the package's main entry point from the local environment.
- The `./publish.sh` script successfully handles building and clearing the `uv` cache, but requires valid PyPI authentication to complete the publishing step when run locally.
- Automated publishing has been set up via a GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/workflow.yml`, triggered on tag pushes.
- The `publish.sh` script has been modified to remove the version incrementing step, as this is now handled manually before tagging for the automated workflow.

## Achievements:

- Modified `publish.sh` to remove the version incrementing step.
- Created `.github/workflows/workflow.yml` for automated publishing via GitHub Actions.
- Updated `README.md`, `plan.md`, and `task.md` to document the new publishing strategy and recommended local execution method.
- Investigated the `uvx` caching issue and confirmed `uv run` as a working alternative for local execution.
- Tested the PyPI API token authentication using `uv publish`, confirming the token is valid when used directly.
