    """Show image(s) correctly.

    This function shows images correctly, making sure that each element in the
    tensor corresponds to a pixel or an integer number of pixels, to avoid
    aliasing (NOTE: this guarantee only holds for the saved image; it should
    generally hold in notebooks as well, but will fail if, e.g., you plot an
    image that's 2000 pixels wide on an monitor 1000 pixels wide; the notebook
    handles the rescaling in a way we can't control).

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : torch.Tensor or list
        The images to display. Tensors should be 4d (batch, channel, height,
        width). List of tensors should be used for tensors of different height
        and width: all images will automatically be rescaled so they're
        displayed at the same height and width, thus, their heights and widths
        must be scalar multiples of each other.
    vrange : `tuple` or `str`
        If a 2-tuple, specifies the image values vmin/vmax that are mapped to
        the minimum and maximum value of the colormap, respectively. If a
        string:

        * `'auto0'`: all images have same vmin/vmax, which have the same absolute
                     value, and come from the minimum or maximum across all
                     images, whichever has the larger absolute value
        * `'auto/auto1'`: all images have same vmin/vmax, which are the
                          minimum/maximum values across all images
        * `'auto2'`: all images have same vmin/vmax, which are the mean (across
                     all images) minus/ plus 2 std dev (across all images)
        * `'auto3'`: all images have same vmin/vmax, chosen so as to map the
                     10th/90th percentile values to the 10th/90th percentile of
                     the display intensity range. For example: vmin is the 10th
                     percentile image value minus 1/8 times the difference
                     between the 90th and 10th percentile
        * `'indep0'`: each image has an independent vmin/vmax, which have the
                      same absolute value, which comes from either their
                      minimum or maximum value, whichever has the larger
                      absolute value.
        * `'indep1'`: each image has an independent vmin/vmax, which are their
                      minimum/maximum values
        * `'indep2'`: each image has an independent vmin/vmax, which is their
                      mean minus/plus 2 std dev
        * `'indep3'`: each image has an independent vmin/vmax, chosen so that
                      the 10th/90th percentile values map to the 10th/90th
                      percentile intensities.
    zoom : `float` or `None`
        ratio of display pixels to image pixels. if >1, must be an integer. If
        <1, must be 1/d where d is a a divisor of the size of the largest
        image. If None, we try to determine the best zoom.
    title : `str`, `list`, or None, optional
        Title for the plot. In addition to the specified title, we add a
        subtitle giving the plotted range and dimensionality (with zoom)
        * if `str`, will put the same title on every plot.
        * if `list`, all values must be `str`, must be the same length as img,
          assigning each title to corresponding image.
        * if None, no title will be printed (and subtitle will be removed).
    col_wrap : `int` or None, optional
        number of axes to have in each row. If None, will fit all axes in a
        single row.
    ax : `matplotlib.pyplot.axis` or None, optional
        if None, we make the appropriate figure. otherwise, we resize the axes
        so that it's the appropriate number of pixels (done by shrinking the
        bbox - if the bbox is already too small, this will throw an Exception!,
        so first define a large enough figure using either make_figure or
        plt.figure)
    cmap : matplotlib colormap, optional
        colormap to use when showing these images
    plot_complex : {'rectangular', 'polar', 'logpolar'}
        specifies handling of complex values.

        * `'rectangular'`: plot real and imaginary components as separate images
        * `'polar'`: plot amplitude and phase as separate images
        * `'logpolar'`: plot log_2 amplitude and phase as separate images
        for any other value, we raise a warning and default to rectangular.
    batch_idx : int or None, optional
        Which element from the batch dimension to plot. If None, we plot all.
    channel_idx : int or None, optional
        Which element from the channel dimension to plot. If None, we plot all.
        Note if this is an int, then `as_rgb=True` will fail, because we
        restrict the channels.
    as_rgb : bool, optional
        Whether to consider the channels as encoding RGB(A) values. If True, we
        attempt to plot the image in color, so your tensor must have 3 (or 4 if
        you want the alpha channel) elements in the channel dimension, or this
        will raise an Exception. If False, we plot each channel as a separate
        grayscale image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    video : torch.Tensor or list
        The videos to display. Tensors should be 5d (batch, channel, time,

        displayed at the same height and width, thus, their heights and widths
        must be scalar multiples of each other. Videos must all have the same
        number of frames as well.

        If a 2-tuple, specifies the image values vmin/vmax that are mapped to

        * `'auto2'`: all images have same vmin/vmax, which are the mean (across
                     all images) minus/ plus 2 std dev (across all images)

                     the display intensity range. For example: vmin is the 10th
                     percentile image value minus 1/8 times the difference

        * `'indep0'`: each image has an independent vmin/vmax, which have the

                      the 10th/90th percentile values map to the 10th/90th

    -------
    anim : matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation
        The animation object. In order to view, must convert to HTML
        or save.

    Notes
    -----

    By default, we use the ffmpeg backend, which requires that you have
    ffmpeg installed and on your path (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
    To use a different, use the matplotlib rcParams:
    `matplotlib.rcParams['animation.writer'] = writer`, see

                     between the 90th and 10th percentile
        * `'indep0'`: each image has an independent vmin/vmax, which have the
                      same absolute value, which comes from either their
                      minimum or maximum value, whichever has the larger
                      absolute value.
        * `'indep1'`: each image has an independent vmin/vmax, which are their
                      minimum/maximum values
        * `'indep2'`: each image has an independent vmin/vmax, which is their
                      mean minus/plus 2 std dev
        * `'indep3'`: each image has an independent vmin/vmax, chosen so that
                      the 10th/90th percentile values map to the 10th/90th
                      percentile intensities.

    By default, stem plot would have a baseline that covers the entire

    there's a line from 0 to 9, from 10 to 19, etc), and passing xvals

    title : str or None, optional

    xvals : `tuple` or `None`, optional
        A 2-tuple of lists, containing the start (``xvals[0]``) and stop
        (``xvals[1]``) x values for plotting. If None, we use the
        default stem plot behavior.

def update_plot(axes, data, model=None, batch_idx=0):
    r"""Update the information in some axes.

    This is used for creating an animation over time. In order to create
    the animation, we need to know how to update the matplotlib Artists,
    and this provides a simple way of doing that. It assumes the plot
    has been created by something like ``plot_representation``, which
    initializes all the artists.

    We can update stem plots, lines (as returned by ``plt.plot``), scatter
    plots, or images (RGB, RGBA, or grayscale).

    There are two modes for this:

    - single axis: axes is a single axis, which may contain multiple artists
      (all of the same type) to update. data should be a Tensor with multiple
      channels (one per artist in the same order) or be a dictionary whose keys
      give the label(s) of the corresponding artist(s) and whose values are
      Tensors.

    - multiple axes: axes is a list of axes, each of which contains a single
      artist to update (artists can be different types). data should be a
      Tensor with multiple channels (one per axis in the same order) or a
      dictionary with the same number of keys as axes, which we can iterate
      through in order, and whose values are Tensors.

    In all cases, data Tensors should be 3d (if the plot we're updating is a
    line or stem plot) or 4d (if it's an image or scatter plot).

    RGB(A) images are special, since we store that info along the channel
    dimension, so they only work with single-axis mode (which will only have a
    single artist, because that's how imshow works).

    If you have multiple axes, each with multiple artists you want to update,
    that's too complicated for us, and so you should write a
    ``model.update_plot()`` function which handles that.

    If ``model`` is set, we try to call ``model.update_plot()`` (which
    must also return artists). If model doesn't have an ``update_plot``
    method, then we try to figure out how to update the axes ourselves,
    based on the shape of the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    axes : `list` or `matplotlib.pyplot.axis`
        The axis or list of axes to update. We assume that these are the axes
        created by ``plot_representation`` and so contain stem plots in the
        correct order.
    data : `torch.Tensor` or `dict`
        The new data to plot.
    model : `torch.nn.Module` or `None`, optional
        A differentiable model that tells us how to plot ``data``. See
        above for behavior if ``None``.
    batch_idx : int, optional
        Which index to take from the batch dimension

    Returns
    -------
    artists : `list`
        A list of the artists used to update the information on the
        plots

    r"""Helper function for plotting model representation

    We are trying to plot ``data`` on ``ax``, using
    ``model.plot_representation`` method, if it has it, and otherwise
    default to a function that makes sense based on the shape of ``data``.

    All of these arguments are optional, but at least some of them need
    to be set:

    - If ``model`` is ``None``, we fall-back to a type of plot based on the
      shape of ``data``. If it looks image-like, we'll use ``plenoptic.imshow``
      and if it looks vector-like, we'll use ``plenoptic.clean_stem_plot``. If
      it's a dictionary, we'll assume each key, value pair gives the title and
      data to plot on a separate sub-plot.

    - If ``data`` is ``None``, we can only do something if
      ``model.plot_representation`` has some default behavior when
      ``data=None``; this is probably to plot its own ``representation``
      attribute. Thus, this will raise an Exception if both ``model`` and
      ``data`` are ``None``, because we have no idea what to plot then.

    - If ``ax`` is ``None``, we create a one-subplot figure using ``figsize``.
      If ``ax`` is not ``None``, we therefore ignore ``figsize``.

    - If ``ylim`` is ``None``, we call ``rescale_ylim``, which sets the axes'
      y-limits to be ``(-y_max, y_max)``, where ``y_max=np.abs(data).max()``.
      If it's ``False``, we do nothing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : `torch.nn.Module` or None, optional
        A differentiable model that tells us how to plot ``data``. See
        above for behavior if ``None``.
    data : `array_like`, `dict`, or `None`, optional
        The data to plot. See above for behavior if ``None``.
    ax : matplotlib.pyplot.axis or None, optional
        The axis to plot on. See above for behavior if ``None``.
    figsize : `tuple`, optional
        The size of the figure to create. Must be ``None`` if ax is not ``None``. If
        both figsize and ax are ``None``, then we set ``figsize=(5, 5)``
    ylim : `tuple`, `None`, or `False`, optional
        If not None, the y-limits to use for this plot. See above for
        behavior if ``None``. If False, we do nothing.
    batch_idx : `int`, optional
        Which index to take from the batch dimension
    title : `str`, optional
        The title to put above this axis. If you want no title, pass
        the empty string (``''``)
    as_rgb : bool, optional
        The representation can be image-like with multiple channels, and we
        have no way to determine whether it should be represented as an RGB
        image or not, so the user must set this flag to tell us. It will be
        ignored if the representation doesn't look image-like or if the
        model has its own plot_representation_error() method. Else, it will
        be passed to `po.imshow()`, see that methods docstring for details.

    Returns
    -------
    axes : list
        List of created axes.
