# Python Package: [impresso-pipelines]

## Overview
This repository contains a Python package designed for efficient and modular processing. Currently, it includes the following subpackages:

- **Language Identification Pipeline**: Pipeline that automatically detects the language of input text and provides its corresponding probability score.
- **OCR QA Pipeline**: Pipeline that evaluates the quality of OCR-processed text by calculating a score (0-1) representing the proportion of recognized words in the input text against a language-specific Bloom filter database.
- **LDA Topics Pipeline**: Pipeline that using topic modelling assigns the most relevant topics to the input text. 



## Installation
To install the package, use:
```bash
pip install impresso_pipelines[all]
```
If you want to install only the language identification pipeline, use:
```bash
pip install impresso_pipelines[langident]
```
If you want to install only the OCR QA pipeline, use:
```bash
pip install impresso_pipelines[ocrqa]
```
If you want to install only the LDA Topics pipeline, use:
```bash
pip install impresso_pipelines[ldatopics]
```

## Usage
Import and use the subpackages as follows:
```python
from impresso_pipelines.langident import LangIdentPipeline
from impresso_pipelines.ocrqa import OCRQAPipeline
from impresso_pipelines.ldatopics import LDATopicsPipeline
```

## Running the Pipeline examples
For examples of how to run each of the pipelines please refer to the individual README files:

- [Langident Pipleine](./impresso_pipelines/langident/README.md)
- [OCR QA Pipeline](./impresso_pipelines/ocrqa/README.md)
- [LDA Topics Pipeline](./impresso_pipelines/ldatopics/README.md)



## More information
For more examples, please take a look at documentation notebooks [langident_pipeline_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/impresso/impresso-datalab-notebooks/tree/main/annotate/langident_pipeline_demo.ipynb) and [ocrqa_pipeline_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/impresso/impresso-datalab-notebooks/tree/main/annotate/ocrqa_pipeline_demo.ipynb).

## Future Plans
More pipelines and subpackages will be added to enhance functionality and broaden use cases. Stay tuned!
