 * FAPEC - high-performance professional data compressor and archiver.
 *
 * @file fapec_decomp.h:
 *
 * @brief Definition of the main decompression functions.
 *
 * FAPEC can be invoked at different levels:
 * - File: similar to invoking the command-line decompressor. It takes care of
 *   all "multi-parts" handling if applicable, identify decompression options
 *   from headers (metadata), rebuild from chunking, multi-thread if requested,
 *   recover from errors if applicable, etc.
 *   It allows decompressing directory trees or several files in a directory.
 *   It can also be used for decompressing just one single file, of course.
 *   This is the most "self-contained" use (all cases can be automatically
 *   handled by FAPEC).
 * - Buffer: quite equivalent to the File case for just 1 single file.
 * - Chunk: This is the most basic invocation level for FAPEC, it is the
 *   core decompression method. Please handle with care: here you need to take
 *   care of "de-chunking" and metadata yourself. That is: a compressed chunk
 *   won't be completely self-contained (you'll need to know and provide the
 *   decompression options). And you need to take care of eventual "de-chunking"
 *   when decompressing large buffers or files.
 * Here we provide functions to decompress from disk to disk (file), from
 * (self-contained) buffer to buffer, from a file to a buffer,
 * and from compressed chunk to decompressed chunk.
 * We also provide convenience functions to access a multi-part (multi-file,
 * folders, etc.) FAPEC archive, getting the number and names of parts
 * contained there, sizes, algorithms used, decompress a specific part
 * to a file or to a buffer, etc.
