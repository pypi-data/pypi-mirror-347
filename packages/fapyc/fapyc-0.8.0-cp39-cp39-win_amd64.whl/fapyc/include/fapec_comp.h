 * FAPEC - high-performance professional data compressor and archiver.
 *
 * @file fapec_comp.h:
 *
 * @brief Definition of the main compression functions.
 *
 * FAPEC can be invoked at different levels:
 * - File: similar to invoking the command-line compressor. It takes care of
 *   all the headers (metadata) generation, "multi-parts" if applicable
 *   (in FAPEC one "part" corresponds to one file and one given compression
 *   setup), chunking, multi-thread if requested, etc.
 *   It allows compressing directory trees or several files in a directory,
 *   if the input parameters request so. It can also be used for compressing
 *   just one single file, of course.
 *   This is the most "self-contained" case (all metadata automatically
 *   handled by FAPEC).
 * - Buffer: equivalent to the File case for just 1 single file.
 *   The buffer will be self-contained regarding compression options
 *   (unless explicitly deactivated).
 * - Chunk: This is the most basic invocation level for FAPEC; it is the
 *   core compression method. Please handle with care: here you need to take
 *   care of "chunking" and metadata yourself. That is: a compressed chunk
 *   won't be completely self-contained (you'll need to know and provide the
 *   compression options when decompressing it). And you need to take care
 *   of eventual "chunking" when compressing large buffers or files: you can
 *   handle up to 384MB at once, in a single chunk, but preferably you should
 *   split it in smaller chunks (typ. 1-16MB). Finally, in some cases
 *   (such as KWCD/KMALL, Tab/CSV or FastQ) you should make sure to provide
 *   "aligned" chunks (each starting at the actual start of a meaningful data
 *   block) to get better compression performance.
 * Here we provide functions to compress from disk to disk (file),
 * from (self-contained) buffer to buffer, from buffer to file, and
 * from raw chunk to compressed chunk.

/**
 * Memory-based single-buffer (chunk) compression function
 *
 * It takes the buffer "buff" of size "buffSize" bytes,
 * compresses it with "cmpCfg" configuration (see e.g. fapec_cmpopts_new)
 * and "userOpts" options (see fapec_usropts_new_ck),
 * and returns the compressed buffer in the same "buff" parameter
 * (updating "buffSize" with the compressed buffer size in bytes).
 * It returns zero (or a positive value to indicate some
 * information from the compression) in case of success,
 * or -1 (or another negative value) to indicate a non-successful compression.
 * The user does not have to worry about the buffer allocated in "buff": the
 * routine frees the available pointer there and allocates a new one for
 * the compressed results. It means that such returned buffer must be freed by
 * the user.
 *
 * @param buff      Pointer to the buffer with the raw data to be compressed.
 *                  It will be updated to point to the new buffer with
 *                  compressed data.
 * @param buffSize  Original (raw, uncompressed) size of the buffer. It will
 *                  be updated to the compressed size.
 * @param userOpts  User/runtime options.
 * @param cmpCfg    FAPEC compression configuration.
 * @return Zero if successul, 2 if the buffer could not be compressed (in
 *         which case the original buffer and size will be returned),
 *         negative in case of errors.

 * Memory-based input+output buffer (chunk) compression function
 *
 * It takes the buffer "inBuff" of size "inBuffSize" bytes,
 * compresses it with "cmpCfg" configuration (see e.g. fapec_cmpopts_new)
 * and "userOpts" options (see fapec_usropts_new_ck),
 * and returns the compressed buffer into the PRE-ALLOCATED "outBuff" parameter
 * (setting "outBuffSize" to the compressed buffer size in bytes).
 * IMPORTANT: outBuff must be preallocated with at least 1.2 x inBuffSize.
 * The value of *outBuffSize does not mind at all.
 * It returns zero (or a positive value to indicate some
 * information from the compression) in case of success,
 * or -1 (or another negative value) to indicate a non-successful compression.
 * Compared to fapec_compress_chunk(), this function is a bit more efficient
 * when we can reuse memory buffers (we avoid the need of allocating+freeing
 * them for every chunk). That is specially interesting when dealing with
 * tiny chunks.
 * Actually, fapec_compress_chunk() calls this function.
 *
 * @param inBuff      Input buffer with the raw data to be compressed.
 * @param inBuffSize  Size of the input buffer.
 * @param outBuff     Pre-allocated output buffer.
 * @param outBuffSize Output buffer size is stored here.
 * @param userOpts    User/runtime options.
 * @param cmpCfg      FAPEC compression configuration.
 * @return Zero if successul, 2 if the buffer could not be compressed (in
 *         which case the original buffer and size will be returned),
 *         negative in case of errors.
