{\bf \underline{Synergistic Activities}}
\vspace{-0.4\baselineskip}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Support of Computational Research: I teach two graduate courses on computational methods, have been an XSEDE Campus Champion, and have been the local coordinator for an XSEDE Blue-Waters course entitled “Algorithmic Techniques for Scalable Many-core Computing” as well as workshops on OpenACC, OpenMP, and MPI. As chair of the Research Computing Committee at Clarkson, I oversee the parallel computing infrastructure at Clarkson, which includes the HPC cluster awarded through our NSF CC* grant.
\item Meeting Organization: Each year I co-organize the Thousand Islands Fluid Mechanics Meeting (TIM) whose goal is to provide a collegial environment for graduate students of the North
Eastern United States and Canada to present their research.
\item STEM Outreach: I am an advisor to the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) engineering program for the Potsdam Central School District. Each year, I help organize campus tours of the research facilities and presentations on various research projects for the PLTW students. The last few
years I have also tried to encourage more women and minorities to enroll in PLTW by having
the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) make
presentations to 8th grade students before they are required to enroll in their high school classes.
\item Science Fair Judging: I volunteer every year to judge the local middle school science fair as well
as the county level fair. I also gather students from the Society of Woman Engineers (SWE) and National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) to volunteer with me.
\item Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): As chair of the department, I have initiated a new
committee on DEI, which started within the department but has expanded to be a school of
engineering committee. This committee includes both students and faculty, and its charge is to
coordinate events promoting DEI in the school.
