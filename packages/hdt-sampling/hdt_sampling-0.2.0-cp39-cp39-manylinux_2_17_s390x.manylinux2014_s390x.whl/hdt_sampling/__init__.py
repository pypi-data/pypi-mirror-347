"""
hdt_sampling â€“ Python wrapper package for the native Rust extension
===================================================================

This lightweight ``__init__.py`` simply re-exports the public symbols from the
compiled extension module built by maturin/PyO3 so that

    >>> from hdt_sampling import HDTSampler

works exactly the same way as importing the extension directly while also giving
us a place to ship typing information (``__init__.pyi``) and the ``py.typed``
marker required by PEP 561.

# The compiled extension may be named either ``_hdt_sampling`` (the modern maturin
# default when a Python source directory is present) or plain ``hdt_sampling`` when
# the crate is built directly.  We try the underscore variant first and fall back
# to the plain name so the package works in both layouts.
