# FastAPI-GENE


A lightweight CLI tool to scaffold fastapi projects, run migrations and migrate migration files.

## Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment and then install **fastapi_gene**:


```console
$ pip install fastapi_gene

```

## Usage

Here are some examples of what **fastapi_gene** can do:

### `fastapi_gene createproject main`

It creates a fastapi project named `main` along with it's subfolder `models`,`schema`,`api` and file `app.py` inside it.

<div class="termy">

```console

main/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â””â”€â”€ main/
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ api/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ item.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ models/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __init__.py
    â””â”€â”€ schema/
        â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
        â””â”€â”€ item.py

```
</div>

To run the project just change path to `main` and run `fastapi dev`.now, you can navigate to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/</a> to see autogenerated `items` endpoints but make sure to install `fastapi` on your enviroment.ðŸ˜Š

### `fastapi_gene createuser fastapi-users[sqlalchemy]`

It creates file and add user table on it as well as map endpoint into your project automatically from `fastapi-users[sqlalchemy]` module but project structure should be maintained to work as smoothly.
- Supported modules are:
  - `fastapi-users[sqlalchemy]`
  - `fastapi-users[sqlalchemy,oauth]`
  - `fastapi-users[beanie]`
  - `fastapi-users[beanie,oauth]`

Now, File structure changed to

<div class="termy">

```console

main/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â””â”€â”€ main/
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ api/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”‚   |â”€â”€ item.py
    |   â””â”€â”€ users.py    #created
    |
    â”œâ”€â”€ models/
    â”‚   |â”€â”€ __init__.py
    |   |â”€â”€ db.py       #created
    |   â””â”€â”€ users.py    #created
    |
    â””â”€â”€ schema/
        â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
        |â”€â”€ item.py
        â””â”€â”€ users.py    #created

// To reflect users endpoint on project include `user_router` in `app.py` as
# app.py

from fastapi import FastAPI
from main.api import item_router,user_router

app = FastAPI()


app.include_router(item_router)
app.include_router(user_router)

```
</div>


### `fastapi_gene makemigrations`
#### `fastapi_gene makemigrations init`
Migrations directory wasnot created to store migrations file. To create that, you should run above command in your terminal and it creates migrations directory named `alembic`. It works same as `alembic init alembic` but you can also provide custom name as `fastapi_gene makemigrations init --name=migrations`

<div class="termy">

```console

main/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ alembic/...  #created
â”œâ”€â”€ alembic.ini  #created
â””â”€â”€ main/...

```
</div>

#### `fastapi_gene makemigrations -m "create user tables" `
After importing `Base` from user model and `sqlalchemy_url` inside env.py of migrations directory, you can run this command which will create the migration file with named `randomnumber_create_user_tables.py` inside version directory of migrations. It works same as `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "create user tables"`.


### `fastapi_gene migrate up`

It applies all migrations upto latest version. It works same as `alembic upgrade head`. By default, it passes `head` revision but you can provide desire revision as `fastapi_gene migrate up revision_id`

### `fastapi_gene migrate down`

It reverts all migrations, bringing the database back to its initial empty state. It works same as `alembic downgrade base`. By default, it passes `base` revision but you can provide desire revision as `fastapi_gene migrate down revision_id`
