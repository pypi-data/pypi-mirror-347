            # The following tools can be used as values for "base_tool":
            #
            # 1️) "bing_search"      - Uses Bing to perform web searches.
            # 2️) "tavily_search"    - Uses Tavily for search queries.
            # 3️) "requests_get"     - Makes an HTTP GET request.
            # 4️) "requests_post"    - Makes an HTTP POST request.
            # 5️) "requests_patch"   - Makes an HTTP PATCH request.
            # 6️) "requests_put"     - Makes an HTTP PUT request.
            # 7️) "requests_delete"  - Makes an HTTP DELETE request.
            # 8) "requests_toolkit" - Contains all of the request tools.
            #
            # Each of these tools may require specific arguments in the "args" section.
            # Refer to the tool's documentation for more details.
            # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            # EXTENSIBILITY
            # - Tool registration can be done without modifying core code by specifying the 
            #   tool configuration file (HOCON format) via the AGENT_BASE_TOOL_INFO_FILE environment variable.
            # - The default tool configuration file is located at: 
            #   neuro_san/internals/run_context/langchain/base_tool_info.hocon
            # - An example tool configuration can be found at:
            #   tests/neuro_san/test_base_tool_info.hocon
            # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            # Future Plans
            # - Instead of using the AGENT_BASE_TOOL_INFO_FILE environment variable, 
            #   integrating the tool configuration directly within the agent network HOCON file.
            # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
