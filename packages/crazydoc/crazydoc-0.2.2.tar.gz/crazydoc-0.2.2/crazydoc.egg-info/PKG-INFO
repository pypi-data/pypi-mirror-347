CrazyDoc
========

Crazydoc is a Python library to parse one of the most common DNA representation formats: the joyfully coloured and stylishly annotated MS Word document.

While other standards such as FASTA or Genbank are better supported by modern sequence editors, none enjoys the same popularity among molecular biologist as MS Word's ``.docx`` format, which is limited only by the sophistication and creativity of the user.
