SQL Injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in the interface between web applications and database servers. The vulnerability occurs when user input is incorrectly filtered and directly included in SQL statements, allowing attackers to manipulate the SQL query.

Exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code that can read sensitive data, modify database data, execute administration operations on the database, recover the content of a given file, and in some cases issue commands to the operating system.

Impact: SQL Injection can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data loss or corruption, and in severe cases, complete system compromise.

Remediation: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements, apply the principle of least privilege to database accounts, validate and sanitize all user inputs, and use ORM frameworks that handle SQL escaping automatically.
""",
            "xss": """
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

Exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser, stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.

Impact: XSS can lead to account theft, data theft, session hijacking, and distribution of malware.

Remediation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs, use content security policy (CSP), encode output data, use modern frameworks that automatically escape XSS by design, and implement XSS filters.
""",
            "csrf": """
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated.

Exploitation: An attacker creates a malicious website, email, or message that contains a request to a vulnerable website. When the victim visits the malicious site or opens the message, the request is sent to the vulnerable site with the victim's cookies, making it appear legitimate.

Impact: CSRF can lead to unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim, such as funds transfer, password change, or data modification.

Remediation: Implement anti-CSRF tokens, use SameSite cookie attribute, verify the origin of requests, and require re-authentication for sensitive actions.
""",

Command Injection is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system through a vulnerable application.

Exploitation: An attacker can inject operating system commands through user input fields that are passed to system functions without proper validation or sanitization.

Impact: Command injection can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, and unauthorized access to the host system.

Remediation: Avoid using system commands when possible, use safer APIs, validate and sanitize all user inputs, implement proper input validation, and run applications with the least privileges necessary.
""",

Path Traversal (Directory Traversal) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended directory by manipulating variables that reference files with "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences.

Exploitation: An attacker can use "../" sequences to navigate to parent directories and access files outside the web root or application directory.

Impact: Path traversal can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, source code disclosure, and in some cases, remote code execution.

Remediation: Validate and sanitize file paths, use a whitelist of allowed files or directories, avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs, and implement proper access controls.

Insecure Deserialization is a vulnerability that occurs when untrusted data is used to abuse the logic of an application, inflict a denial of service (DoS) attack, or even execute arbitrary code.

Exploitation: An attacker can modify serialized objects to manipulate application logic, inject malicious code, or exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process.

Impact: Insecure deserialization can lead to remote code execution, denial of service, authentication bypass, and privilege escalation.

Remediation: Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources, implement integrity checks, use safer serialization formats, and monitor deserialization activities.
""",
            "xxe": """
XML External Entity (XXE) is a vulnerability that occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser.

Exploitation: An attacker can exploit XXE to disclose internal files, perform server-side request forgery (SSRF), or execute remote code.

Impact: XXE can lead to data theft, server-side request forgery, denial of service, and in some cases, remote code execution.

Remediation: Disable external entity processing, use less complex data formats like JSON, patch or upgrade XML parsers, and implement proper input validation.
""",

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing.

Exploitation: An attacker can manipulate the server to send requests to internal services, cloud services, or external systems, bypassing network security controls.

Impact: SSRF can lead to unauthorized access to internal services, data theft, and in some cases, remote code execution.

Remediation: Implement a whitelist of allowed domains and protocols, validate and sanitize all user inputs, use a dedicated service for remote resource access, and implement network-level protections.
""",

Authentication Bypass is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a system or application by circumventing the authentication mechanism.

Exploitation: An attacker can exploit weaknesses in authentication logic, such as hardcoded credentials, weak password policies, or flawed session management.

Impact: Authentication bypass can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, and complete system compromise.

Remediation: Implement strong authentication mechanisms, use multi-factor authentication, avoid hardcoded credentials, implement proper session management, and regularly audit authentication code.
""",

Authorization Bypass is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to gain access to resources or perform actions that should be restricted.

Exploitation: An attacker can exploit weaknesses in authorization logic, such as missing access controls, insecure direct object references, or flawed role-based access control.

Impact: Authorization bypass can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, and unauthorized actions.

Remediation: Implement proper access controls, use role-based access control, validate user permissions for each request, and avoid insecure direct object references.

Hardcoded Credentials is a vulnerability that occurs when authentication credentials (such as passwords, API keys, or tokens) are embedded directly in the source code.

Exploitation: An attacker who gains access to the source code can extract the hardcoded credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to systems or services.

Impact: Hardcoded credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, and complete system compromise.

Remediation: Store credentials in secure configuration files, environment variables, or secure credential management systems, and implement proper access controls.

Weak Encryption is a vulnerability that occurs when an application uses cryptographic algorithms or implementations that are considered insecure or outdated.
