# USB Programming Tool for WCH Microcontrollers
## Description
With this tool, almost all WCH microcontrollers (CH5xx, CH6xx, CH32Fxxx, CH32Vxxx, CH32Xxxx, and CH32Lxxx) which have a factory-builtin bootloader (v2.x.x) can be flashed via USB.

## Preparations
On Linux you do not need to install a driver for the USB bootloader. However, by default Linux will not expose enough permission to upload your code. In order to fix this, open a terminal and run the following commands:

```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="4348", ATTR{idProduct}=="55e0", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ch55x.rules
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="55e0", MODE="666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ch55x.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

For Windows, you need the [CH372 driver](http://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH372DRV_EXE.html). Alternatively, you can also use the [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) tool to install the correct driver. Here, click "Options" -> "List All Devices" and select the USB module. Then install the libusb-win32 driver. To do this, the board must be connected and the microcontroller must be in bootloader mode.

## Installation
Ensure that the [prerequisites](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/) for installing Python packages are met. Then execute the following command in the command line:

```
pip install chprog
```

## Usage
The bootloader must be started manually for new uploads. To do this, the board must first be disconnected from the USB port and all voltage sources. Now press the BOOT button and keep it pressed while reconnecting the board to the USB port of your PC. The chip now starts in bootloader mode, the BOOT button can be released and new firmware can be uploaded via USB. Alternatively, you can leave the board connected to the USB port, press and hold the BOOT button, press and release the RESET button and then release the BOOT button to enter the bootloader mode. If there is no BOOT button on the board, look at the datasheet to find out which pin needs to be pulled to which voltage level for the microcontroller to go into boot mode.

Now run the following command (example):
```
chprog firmware.bin
```
