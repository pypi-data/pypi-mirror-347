# Datoso Seed Super Famicom MSU1

Datoso is a WIP Python command line tool to download and organize your Dat Roms.
As today the tool supports dat-omatic, redump, and translated-english dats.
It merges all the dats in a tree folder structure thought to use with Emulators rather than dats.
The dat file format must be compatible with [ROMVault](https://www.romvault.com/).
