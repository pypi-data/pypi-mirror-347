NVIDIA CLOUD AGREEMENT

IMPORTANT NOTICE - PLEASE READ AND AGREE BEFORE USING NVIDIA CLOUD SERVICE.

This NVIDIA Cloud Agreement is entered into between the entity you represent, or, if you do not designate an entity in connection with a Subscription purchase or renewal, you individually (“Customer”), and NVIDIA Corporation (“NVIDIA”) and governs the use of the Cloud Service. This NVIDIA Cloud Agreement consists of the terms and conditions below and all documents attached to, or referenced in, this NVIDIA Cloud Agreement (together, the “Agreement”). Key terms are defined in Section 18. Customer and NVIDIA are each a “party” and collectively the “parties.”

By registering to use or using the Cloud Service, Customer is affirming that Customer has read the Agreement and agrees to its terms. If Customer does not have the required authority to enter into the Agreement or if Customer does not accept all Agreement terms and conditions, do not register to use or use the Cloud Service.

PROVISION OF THE CLOUD SERVICE.

1.1 Access. NVIDIA will provide the Cloud Service in accordance with the Agreement and as specified in an Order Form, license key or the offering description (as applicable). Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Customer and its Authorized Users may access and use the Cloud Service.

1.2 Authorized Users. Only Customer Personnel may access and use the Cloud Service, unless otherwise explicitly stated in Service-Specific Terms. Customer is responsible for the compliance with the terms of the Agreement by Customer’s Authorized Users. Any act or omission that if committed by Customer would constitute a breach of the Agreement will be deemed to constitute a breach of the Agreement if committed by Customer’s Authorized Users.

1.3 Subscription Types. Customer’s Order Form, license key or the offering description will indicate the parameters of Customer’s Subscription.

1.4 Customer Testing. Customer may perform limited vulnerability or penetration testing of the Cloud Offerings with NVIDIA’s prior written approval and only in coordination with the NVIDIA security team. Customer must not violate or attempt to violate the security, confidentiality, integrity or availability of any data, and NVIDIA may require Customer to cease any testing, or may take appropriate actions to secure the Cloud Offerings. Without NVIDIA’s advanced written approval, Customer is not authorized to disclose the results of any security testing related to the Cloud Offerings.

1.5 Promotional Offerings. NVIDIA may, from time to time, offer free or discounted pricing programs covering certain uses of Cloud Services, for example having different license parameters or fees for evaluation or academic use. NVIDIA may stop accepting new sign-ups or discontinue a promotional offering at any time. Standard charges will apply after a promotional offering ends or if Customer exceeds the promotional offering use terms. Customer must comply with any additional terms, restrictions, or limitations (e.g., limitations on the total amount or duration of use) for a promotional offering as described in the corresponding offer terms.

1.6 Customer Access. If requested by NVIDIA, Customer must assign a single point of contact to manage access to the Cloud Service.

USER CONTENT.

2.1 Customer User Content. For User Content that Customer uploads, stores or shares, Customer represents that Customer either owns the User Content it provides to other Authorized Users, or Customer has all rights, licenses, consents, and releases that are necessary to grant the rights for other Authorized Users to use the User Content Customer shares in connection with the Agreement. Customer is solely responsible for any User Content that Customer uploads, stores or shares, including (i) any personal information relating to an identifiable individual, financial, health or governmental information, or any other information which may be subject to data privacy or data security laws, rules, or regulations; and (ii) any security vulnerabilities of User Content and related consequences.

2.2 DPA. The DPA is hereby incorporated by reference into the Agreement. If stated in the Service-Specific Terms for a Cloud Service, NVIDIA will process Customer’s User Content uploaded, stored or shared for that Cloud Service in accordance with the DPA.

2.3 Providing User Content. Customer may be able to provide User Content in repositories for use by multiple Authorized Users who are granted access to the repository. It is Customer’s responsibility to have in place terms for use of User Content Customer uploads, stores or shares with other Authorized Users. Any User Content is shared at Customer’s sole risk and Customer understands that others with access may read, collect, organize, use and modify the User Content.

2.4 User Content Transmission. Customer acknowledges and agrees that NVIDIA does not manage or control User Content that Customer or other Authorized Users upload, store, share or access through the Cloud Service. NVIDIA accepts no responsibility or liability for User Content including, without limitation, privacy rights, proprietary rights, or legal and regulatory compliance and regardless of whether such User Content was transmitted to or by Customer in breach of the Agreement.

2.5 User Content Grant to NVIDIA. For User Content that Customer uploads, stores or shares, Customer hereby grants NVIDIA, its Affiliates, their personnel, and NVIDIA subcontractors a non-exclusive, worldwide, limited license to access, use, copy, display, and transmit User Content for the sole purpose of providing the Cloud Service to Customer and Customer’s Authorized Users. Except as expressly provided in this Section 2 or otherwise explicitly stated in Service-Specific Terms, NVIDIA will not access, use, copy, display, transmit, or download User Content for any other purpose.

PRE-RELEASE AND FREE FEATURES AND OFFERINGS.

3.1 Pre-Release. NVIDIA will clearly designate features and Cloud Offerings that are in Pre-Release. Pre-Release versions may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercially provided NVIDIA software, materials and services. Use of a Pre-Release version may result in unexpected results, such as loss of use or loss of content. Customer may use a Pre-Release version at Customer’s risk, understanding that such versions are not intended for use in business-critical systems and Customer may stop at Customer’s convenience. NVIDIA has no obligation to update or maintain in any manner Pre-Release or free Cloud Offerings, and NVIDIA may choose to abandon development and terminate the availability of a Pre-Release version at any time without liability.

3.2 Additional Terms. Customer agrees to comply with any additional terms, restrictions, or limitations (e.g., limitations on the total amount of use or duration) applicable to Pre-Release and free offerings as communicated by NVIDIA to Customer. NVIDIA may stop accepting new sign-ups or discontinue a Pre-Release, early access or free offering at any time. Standard charges may apply after an early access program ends or if Customer exceeds the offering use terms.

3.3 Pre-Release and Free Offerings Are “AS-IS”. Pre-release and free features and Cloud Offerings are provided “AS-IS,” “WITH ALL FAULTS,” and “AS-AVAILABLE,” and are excluded from Enterprise Support, the SLA, and all limited warranties provided in the Agreement.

UPDATES AND MAINTENANCE.

4.1 Updates. NVIDIA may change, discontinue or deprecate any part, or all, of the Cloud Service, or change or remove features, functionality or content available as further detailed in the documentation. For Customers that have a paid Subscription, NVIDIA will strive to provide substantially similar service or functionality and to notify Customers in advance if NVIDIA discontinues or makes material changes to existing functionality.

4.2 Maintenance. The Cloud Service may be temporarily unavailable, inaccessible or slow when NVIDIA is performing maintenance or upgrades or at other times for reasons not within NVIDIA’s reasonable control.

5 SLA AND ENTERPRISE SUPPORT. The Cloud Services under a paid Subscription are provided in accordance with the SLA and include Enterprise Support, unless otherwise indicated in the Service-Specific Terms or an Order Form. Any Pre-Release or free Cloud Offerings (i) are not subject to the SLA, and (ii) Enterprise Support, if any, will be provided at NVIDIA’s discretion.

6 SECURITY CREDENTIALS. If Customer log-in or authentication and authorization is required for Customer access to the Cloud Service, Customer is responsible for securely maintaining any security credentials and log-in information for Customer Authorized Users’ use, and for all activities under Customer’s account(s). Customer agrees to notify NVIDIA at enterprisesupport@nvidia.com immediately of any known or suspected security incidents or unauthorized use of Customer’s account(s) or the Cloud Service.

7 PAYMENT TERMS AND TAXES. These terms apply when Customer purchases a Subscription.

7.1 Fees and Taxes. Customer may be able to purchase a Subscription through an Order Form from NVIDIA or an NVIDIA-authorized reseller, in some cases a cloud marketplace reseller. Each Order Form will be effective when entered into by the reseller and Customer or by the Customer and NVIDIA, as applicable. Each order placed by Customer through an Order Form is a separate transaction of the parties under the Agreement. The fees for the Subscription set forth in the Order Form will be exclusive of all transactional taxes, including sales, use, excise, services, value added, goods and services, or similar tax. If Customer is not billed the applicable tax under the Order Form, then it is Customer’s responsibility to properly remit the tax directly to the applicable tax jurisdiction. Further, Customer acknowledges that the payments to a reseller under the Agreement will be made in full without reduction for withholding taxes, if applicable.

7.2 Overdue Payment. If any payment is overdue from Customer or a reseller, NVIDIA reserves the right to suspend or terminate Subscriptions, in addition to any other remedies it may have, until the payment delinquency is corrected. Payment obligations survive any expiration or termination of the Agreement.

7.3 Price Changes. Any price change will only apply to purchases after the price change.

8 LIMITATIONS. The following limitations and restrictions apply to the Cloud Service use, and Customer is responsible for the consequences of non-conformance with these limitations:

8.1 Customer will use the Cloud Service and User Content exclusively for authorized purposes, consistent with the Agreement’s terms and all applicable laws, regulations and the rights of others, including, without limitation, Intellectual Property Rights, confidentiality, publicity, export and import, security and data privacy, including health information privacy, laws, rules and regulations, and further Customer will not promote or encourage conduct that can lead to illegal activities or give rise to legal liability.

8.2 Customer’s use of the Cloud Service and User Content will not (i) be fraudulent, false, misleading, deceptive, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, vulgar, or offensive; or (ii) engage, facilitate or promote violence, discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment, or harm against any individual or group.

Customer acknowledges that NVIDIA does not design, test, manufacture or certify the Cloud Service for use in the context of a Critical Application. Beyond NVIDIA delivering the Cloud Service in accordance with the Agreement, NVIDIA will not be liable to Customer or any third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or damages arising from such uses.

9 CONFIDENTIALITY.

9.1 Right to Use Confidential Information. The receiving party may use the disclosing party’s Confidential Information only to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under the Agreement. The receiving party may disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information to its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, contractors, independent external auditors, and advisors (including legal and accounting) who have a need to know that information in their work for the receiving party under the Agreement and who are bound to protect that information under obligations of confidentiality at least as restrictive as those described in the Agreement. The receiving party will not disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information to any third party, except as expressly authorized in the Agreement, without first having written approval of the disclosing party. The receiving party will protect the Confidential Information of the disclosing party with at least the same degree of care that the receiving party uses to protect its own similar confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care. Irrespective of any expiration or termination of the Agreement, the receiving party’s duty to protect the disclosing party’s Confidential Information expires five (5) years after the date Confidential Information was disclosed. If the disclosing party sends a written request, the receiving party will promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information received from the disclosing party, together with copies, except that a party may retain archival copies in accordance with its document retention policy or as required by law.

9.2 Exceptions. Confidential Information does not and will not include information that: (i) was in the public domain at the time it was communicated to the receiving party by the disclosing party, or later entered the public domain other than by a breach of the Agreement by the receiving party, (ii) is or was rightfully received or known by the receiving party without restriction on disclosure or any obligation of confidentiality, (iii) is or was independently developed by or for the receiving party without using any of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, or (iv) is or was generally made available by the disclosing party without restriction on disclosure. The receiving party will not be liable for disclosure of Confidential Information required to be disclosed in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body of competent jurisdiction. The receiving party will (unless restricted) provide the disclosing party with prior written notice of the required disclosure to permit the disclosing party to seek confidential treatment of such information and disclose only the information necessary to comply with the requirements.

10 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION.

10.1 Automatic Termination. Customer’s access to the Cloud Service terminates automatically without notice from NVIDIA upon expiration of Customer’s Subscription. Customer’s access to Pre-Release and free Cloud Offerings terminates automatically without notice from NVIDIA upon expiration of the applicable Pre-Release or free trial period.

10.2 Early Termination. NVIDIA may at any time with advance written notice terminate the Agreement or an Order Form, in whole or in part, (i) if use of the Cloud Service or User Content materially breaches the terms of the Agreement, (ii) if Customer commences or participates in any legal proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the Cloud Service or User Content, or (iii) as needed, in NVIDIA’s reasonable judgment, to comply with laws and regulations or to comply with its service provider agreements. For example, NVIDIA may modify or terminate an offering in connection with a government requirement that would cause NVIDIA to be regulated as a telecommunications provider. Additionally, NVIDIA may at any time for any reason terminate the availability or a Customer’s use of a Pre-Release or free Cloud Offering. Customer may terminate at any time the Agreement or an Order Form if NVIDIA does not timely cure a material breach of the Agreement. If the termination basis is breach and the breach is curable, the other party will have thirty (30) days from the date of notification to cure the breach, or five (5) days to cure if the breach is of a payment obligation.

10.3 Suspension. NVIDIA may at any time suspend or restrict Customer or any of Customer’s Authorized Users’ access to the Cloud Service for the reasons that may lead to termination as described in Section 10.2, or to perform maintenance (whether planned or unplanned). NVIDIA will strive to provide advance notice of suspension, although in some cases the notice may follow suspension. Additionally, NVIDIA may at any time for any reason suspend the availability or a Customer’s use of a Pre-Release or free Cloud Offering.

10.4 Effects of Suspension or Termination. Upon the suspension or termination of the Agreement or an Order Form, Customer will cease using the Cloud Service and any fees owed to NVIDIA will become immediately due and payable even if longer terms have been agreed earlier. NVIDIA or an NVIDIA reseller will also bill Customer for any outstanding payment obligations during a Subscription period in the event of early termination for any reason other than for NVIDIA’s uncured material breach. No credit or refund will be provided for Subscription fees paid to NVIDIA or NVIDIA reseller. It is highly recommended that that Customer maintains its full data backup, as NVIDIA will not retain Customer’s data for Customer’s retrieval. Upon Customer’s request, NVIDIA will suggest data practices and options to help establish Customer’s data backup protocols.

10.5 Enterprise Support Termination. Enterprise Support ends at the earlier of the expiration or termination of the Cloud Service Subscription, and no credit or refund will be provided.

10.6 Investigation and Reporting. NVIDIA may investigate violations of the Agreement or misuse of the Cloud Service, and subject to the terms in the Agreement, may report activities to law enforcement, regulators or other authorities.

10.7 Survival. All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, the terms in Section 7 through Section 18.

11 DATA COLLECTION.

11.1 Collection Purposes. Unless otherwise stated in Service-Specific Terms, the following applies: Customer hereby acknowledges that the Cloud Service may collect the following data for the following purposes: (i) configuration and operating system data to properly configure and optimize systems for use with the Cloud Service; (ii) metrics, logs, settings, configurations, installed applications and drivers used with the Cloud Service, application settings, performance and usage data of the Cloud Service to operate and improve the Cloud Service, and (iii) error logs relating to the Cloud Service for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes.

11.4 Third Party Privacy Practices. The Cloud Service may contain links to third party websites and services, and Customer’s use of third-party products and services may be subject to such third-party privacy statements or practices. NVIDIA is not responsible for the privacy statements or practices of third parties.

11.5 Privacy Policy. Please review the NVIDIA Privacy Policy, located at https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/privacy-policy/, which explains NVIDIA’s policy for collecting and using data, as well as visit the NVIDIA Privacy Center , located at https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/privacy-center, to manage Customer’s consent and privacy preferences.
