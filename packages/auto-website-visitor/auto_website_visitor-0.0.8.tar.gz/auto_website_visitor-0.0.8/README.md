### Browser Installation (Linux)

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you have the latest version of your browser installed.
> AWV uses Selenium to control the browser, so it needs the browser to be installed on your system.
> If you have a different version of the browser, please check the [Selenium documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/) for compatibility.
